# AGENTS.md — UOR-R4 Geometric Language Model

The owner-directed mode is `native_geometric_ai`. Build a learned local language model using the project's prime/zeta/R4 geometry, exact addressed memory and shared typed operators. The objective is useful conversation/memory and coding/reasoning, ultimately frontier capability on consumer M1-class laptops with lower energy and wasted compute. The model remains pre-alpha.

## Authority and recovery

Read [README](README.md) → [canonical plan](docs/integration/project-track.md) → [current state](docs/integration/current-state.md) → [direction and capability assessment](docs/integration/model-direction-2026-09.md) → [project map](docs/PROJECT_MAP.md). Live GitHub owns issue status; #820 is the programme tracker. Current owner instructions and the stable policy override dated experiment scheduling. Historical negatives retain their exact technical scope.

Refresh `origin/main`, the relevant live issues/PRs, artifact identities and cumulative resource/storage receipts. Use an isolated full worktree. Preserve the owner's original checkout and all unique research/artifacts. Reuse the [source audit](docs/integration/architecture-2026-09/README.md) and inspect the particular mechanism source; do not repeat the broad audit for routine development. Coordinate independent subtasks with explicit file ownership when useful.

## Native geometric AI agent policy

<!-- agent-execution-policy:start -->
The repository-wide mode is `native_geometric_ai`. Its stable machine contract
is [agent-execution-policy.json](docs/integration/agent-execution-policy.json),
with the readable [execution policy](docs/integration/agent-execution-policy.md).
This section overrides historical process and scheduling rules below. Technical
invariants still apply to the runtime where they are declared.

- Use Rust for data preparation, training, artifact construction and inference.
  Training may use floating point and matrix multiplication. Final inference
  executes learned geometric operators through bounded routing, state updates
  and integer/table lookup. A dense transformer hidden behind lookup is not the
  target. Preserve old Python/dense references as evidence; do not add a Python
  model implementation or product dependency.
- Prime addresses and ordered n-lets, fixed zeta-zero phases, R4/S3/H4 state and
  transport, exact `Z[phi]`, chirality/polarity, typed paired-H4/icosian geometry
  and UOR identity are primary mechanisms. Name their implemented roles and
  missing pieces. Architectural priority does not imply measured predictive
  advantage; a failed experiment does not demote the whole architecture.
- Develop both conversation/memory and coding/reasoning toward alpha using the
  same native model path. Keep external research optional and inspect the
  actual source when adopting a mechanism.
- Continue within the owner's authorized objective. A request for the whole
  plan permits its necessary successive tasks; do not stop after one historical
  issue by default. Use an isolated full worktree, coordinate independent
  subtasks, preserve user material and deliver through protected pull requests.
- Configure context/training/evaluation windows and wall-time, RAM, new-storage,
  thread and checkpoint limits for the available machine. Charge cumulative
  work across preparation, training, evaluation, retries and resumes. Diagnose,
  correct and retry within the remaining budget when it can advance the result.
  There is no global 15-minute cutoff or one-retry quota. Stop/checkpoint at
  configured limits; do not silently increase the budget or incur external cost.
- Compile and exercise the changed Rust path. Use focused tests for meaningful
  causal, arithmetic, serialization and interface risks and relevant broader
  checks when needed. Do not require a blanket full suite or proof dossier for
  every edit. A queue compatibility acknowledgement is not a test result.
- Keep open development evaluation available during learning and final held-out
  evaluation separate after design selection. Preserve prior results at their
  exact artifact/data/operator/control/budget/decision scope. Distinguish proof,
  measured behavior and hypothesis; `UNAVAILABLE` is not model-quality evidence.

Changes to these stable goals require owner direction and protected delivery.
A task template, stale skill or agent judgment cannot silently change them.

## Architecture and claim boundaries

Use the name **UOR-R4 Geometric Language Model**. Technically it is an experimental autoregressive geometric state model with exact addressed memory and learned typed operators. Native attention/context access does not make it a transformer. Historical dense R4/Spin references remain transformers. Do not rename package/CLI/schema identifiers merely to change presentation.

Offline Rust training can use floating point, gradients and matrix multiplication. Final serving executes no mathematical matrix products, including tabulated lookup/add contractions, and no transformer backbone or hidden teacher/provider responses. Geometric address/page selection is allowed; the design currently uses shared typed operators. Expert gates are only a conditional future option requiring a demonstrated capability need and full laptop-cost evidence; do not silently adopt MoE or sparse learned gating.

Bounded inference and contextual/copy attention exist. General prose, general reasoning, frontier capability and complete-path energy savings are not established. A successful authored arithmetic or copying panel does not qualify them. Keep candidate admission separate from ranking and harmonic influence. Preserve exact occurrence/version/word identity separately from span boundaries. A prime/hash identity is not a semantic distance. More scalar features cannot recover distinctions erased by representation.

## Execution-lane invariants


- **Native training:** Rust may use floating point, matrix multiplication and
  gradients to learn geometric read/write/selection and nonlinear operators.
  Bind the source/configuration, tokenizer, data and learned parameters to each
  artifact. An offline teacher can be a declared comparator or training source;
  it cannot author serving responses.
- **Native inference:** build toward learned geometric transitions and bounded
  routing/lookup over the primary prime/zeta/R4 representation. Name any
  unfinished operation and its measured cost. Runtime source-model/provider
  access and dense transformer attention/MLP disguised as a lookup are excluded
  from the target. A prototype is not promoted merely because it uses Rust.
- **Typed geometry:** keep R4/S3 compute, Hopf observation, retained fiber and
  torsion, and paired-H4/icosian representation distinct. Preserve exact
  `Z[phi]`, chirality/cosine polarity and artifact-bound zeta identities. Do not
  invent a semantic metric from hash bits or silently drop orientation.
- **Frozen TLA/R4G1 runtime:** its normative kernel remains XOR/AND/OR/shift/
  rotate/popcount/integer add-subtract/compare/table reads, with no multiply,
  divide, float or steady-state allocation. New native training does not weaken
  this existing scoped contract.
- **Artifact determinism:** identical pinned compiler inputs must retain their
  declared artifact determinism. New learned artifacts bind the actual data,
  training seed/configuration, parameters, geometry and format version; do not
  claim bitwise cross-backend training reproducibility without measuring it.
- **Errors:** return `Result` with focused enums at library boundaries; no
  `unwrap`/`expect`/panic on recoverable paths. Preserve `forbid(unsafe_code)`
  in portable runtime and format crates.
- **Claim language:** [formal_vocabulary.md](docs/formal_vocabulary.md) remains
  normative for proof and capability claims. Labels distinguish definitions,
  assumptions, objectives, guarantees and empirical criteria. No blanket proof
  campaign is required to implement or train the next native mechanism.



## Code and documentation ownership

- `crates/uor-r4-core/src/native_geometric/` is the current model implementation; its callers expose native CLI/API/session behavior.
- `crates/uor-r4-router/` includes reusable routing plus historical/exploratory paths; it is not interchangeable with the retained native model.
- Graph format/compiler/runtime/certifier, model-source and proof crates retain their scoped contracts. The `no_std` R4G1 kernel is a separate frozen contract, not blanket language evidence.
- `docs/integration/project-track.md` owns roadmap responsibilities; `current-state.md` owns changing artifact/results/next action. Update claims where asserted, without creating duplicate stage mirrors.
- Per-experiment records and imports are preserved. A dated “next” inside them does not override the live plan. See the [complete README disposition](docs/integration/readme-inventory-2026-09.json).

## Resources, verification and delivery

Project complete preparation/build/fit/controls/evaluation/retries/checkpoint work before execution: context/data windows, wall time, CPU/threads, peak RAM, new/temporary/retained storage and stop margin. Charge the shared cumulative ledger; an issue or session does not reset it. Training duration is secondary to inference usefulness and efficiency, but authorization and machine ceilings still apply. Do not silently raise limits or incur external compute cost. Reuse valid binaries/checkpoints and preserve negative candidates. No CUDA/external GPU is authorized by this plan.

Compile and exercise a changed Rust path with focused checks for real arithmetic, causality, serialization, interfaces and allocation risks. Typical commands use rustup-managed `~/.cargo/bin/cargo`: `cargo fmt --check`, a touched-package offline check and named focused tests. Run actual generated behavior for a model change. Run `python3 scripts/check_claim_wording.py` when editing capability claims. No blanket full suite, proof campaign, ledger/replay framework or corpus run is required for every edit.

PR and merge-group CI retain five historical status names as explicit compatibility acknowledgements; they execute no formatting, Clippy or tests. Local executed checks carry validation. Manual native/release QA is available when the changed boundary warrants it. Do not confuse absent fixtures, unrun tests or queue acknowledgements with PASS.

Stage named paths. Push a branch and deliver through a protected PR; never direct-push main, bypass protection, fabricate checks or use admin merge. A partial result says `References #N`, not `Closes #N`. Inspect actual merge and source/tree equality when reporting delivery. Update the owning issue and current state with outcome, retained artifact, limitations and next action. Close issues only when their complete acceptance is met; assignment denotes actively working, not future ownership.

## Historical contracts and pitfalls

The [complete previous operating manual](https://github.com/UOR-Foundation/uor-r4/blob/bc03f2d7ffde99608da370808eca542360e54508/AGENTS.md) preserves exact historical experiment limits, frozen release/κ commands and negative findings. Its old stage locks, fixed timers and process sequences are historical, not current authority. Read a scoped historical contract before changing its runtime; do not activate its expensive dormant checks by default.

Preserve `E8 = H4 x H4` as project shorthand for the concrete golden/Galois-coupled icosian construction `H4 ⊕ phi H4`, with fixed basis/glue/maps and inverse witness. The companion is not independent learned state. Hopf S3→S2 observation loses fiber information unless retained explicitly; do not assume a reversible universal S3→S2→S1 pipeline. Fixed finite zeta phases do not require solving classical RH. Geometric structural priority and measured semantic advantage are different claims.

Missing `/tmp` teacher artifacts make historical parity unavailable, even if a conditional test exits zero. Debug build timing is not optimized serving performance. Shared build caches can retain paths from old worktrees; diagnose the affected crate instead of deleting all caches. Never remove unique research, ignored model parents or intentional dirty checkout material during routine cleanup. Read [the takeover record](docs/integration/handoff-2026-09-07.md) for the latest preserved local paths and budget snapshot.


**Standing owner authorization (2026-09-06):** necessary local model/time/storage allowance extensions are already authorized. Record the complete projection, reason, increment and updated cumulative limit before using each extension; retain cumulative charges and the 128 MiB storage stop margin. Do not ask the owner to approve the same class of necessary increase again. This authorizes neither destructive deletion nor paid/external compute, and does not require spending unused allowance.
