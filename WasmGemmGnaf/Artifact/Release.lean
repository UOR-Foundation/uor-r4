  Artifact/Release.lean --- the concrete release instantiation, and UV-003.

  Normative sources: SPEC.md sections 1 (`GlobalOptimal`), 7.2 (the release
  profile), 8.3 (the release problem), 9.3 (the release objective), 10.1 (the
  competitor universe and `Universal.evaluate`) and 13 (Phase D).

  ## WHAT THIS FILE PROVES

  It discharges obligation **UV-003**: the decider hypothesis
  `Universal.DeciderAnswersAdmissible`, which `Universal/Argmin.lean` isolated
  and could not derive.  With it discharged,
  `Release.exists_globalOptimal_of_nonempty` reduces the release theorem to a
  single remaining obligation — nonemptiness of the admissible, evaluated set.

  It also proves that the release relation `Universal.SystemEvaluationRel`,
  instantiated at this decider, satisfies exactly the three properties SPEC §1
  demands of it: **sound**, **functional**, and **complete for every profile
  valid, semantically correct, resource bounded module that has an evaluation**.

  ## THE PRICE, STATED PLAINLY

  `Release.decider` is **noncomputable**.  It is defined by
  `Classical.propDecidable` on `Nonempty (Universal.SystemEvaluation …)` and by
  `Classical.choice` on the inhabitant.  Consequently:

  * It is **not** SPEC §10.1's "implemented finite decoder, validator, input
    enumerator and all-branch explorer".  It names no procedure, enumerates
    nothing, explores nothing, and cannot be run.
  * It **computes no artifact**.  `exists_globalOptimal_of_nonempty` yields an
    existential; `Release.decider` contributes nothing towards exhibiting a
    concrete winning byte sequence, and nothing here may be read as an emitted
    release.
  * What it does satisfy is the *relational* contract — soundness,
    functionality, completeness — and that relational contract is precisely
    what `Universal.GlobalOptimal` consumes.  `GlobalOptimal` never asks the
    decider to be executable; it asks that the decider's answer on an
    admissible competitor *be* that competitor's evaluation.

  That distinction is the difference between the theorem being provable and an
  artifact being emittable.  This file achieves the first and does not touch
  the second.

  `Classical.choice` is used, deliberately and only, in
  `Release.evaluateClassically` (and hence in `Release.decider`, which is a
  one-field wrapper around it).  Neither is on an executable path, and neither
  is claimed to produce an executable witness.  Every other declaration in this
  file is a definition or a proved theorem; there is no `sorry`, no `admit`, no
  project axiom, no `native_decide`, no `unsafe` and no `partial`.

  ## THE SEAM IS CONSTRUCTED (GO-008)

  §5 below builds a `Release.Seam` and proves it is not degenerate.  Items 2, 3
  and 4 of what used to be this file's hypothesis list are now definitions:

  * `Release.semantics` — `Release.costEvent` together with
    `Wasm.validationCost` and `Wasm.instantiatedStaticBytes`, assembled by
    `Release.semanticsFor`.
  * `Release.machine` — `Wasm.releaseCostedMachine` of `Wasm/CostedExplore.lean`:
    `Wasm.initialGemmInvocationCosted` and the bounded all-branch costed
    explorer `Wasm.exploreAllCosted`.
  * `Release.limit` — five coordinates pinned verbatim from
    `Gemm.releaseResourceContract`, eleven supplied at the profile maximum the
    pinned costed-step budget implies.  `Release.limit_pinned` and
    `Release.limit_unpinned` say which are which.
  * `Release.seam` — the three of them, as a closed term.

  Non-degeneracy is proved, not asserted:

  * `Release.seam_costEvent_not_zero` and `Release.seam_costEvent_charge_pos` —
    the cost model is not free.
  * `Release.seam_validationSteps_pos` — validation is not free.
  * `Release.seam_machine_completes` — on `Release.witnessModule` the machine
    initializes and returns a **completed, nonempty, canonically ordered**
    costed frontier at every raw invocation.
  * `Release.systemEvaluation_inhabited` — `Universal.SystemEvaluation` at
    `Release.setting Release.seam` is inhabited, on the closed literal
    `Release.witnessBytes`, which is also `Universal.ProfileValid`.

  ## THREE DISCLOSURES THAT TRAVEL WITH THE CONSTRUCTION

  1. **`Release.costEvent` is a lower bound, not SPEC §7.5's contribution law.**
     `Universal.Semantics.costEvent` maps a *plain* `Wasm.Event`, and a plain
     event does not carry the transferred byte count, the `memory.grow` delta or
     the installed byte count — `Wasm.Event.step` alone is the erasure of
     fourteen distinct rules.  `Release.costEvent` charges the pinned rule-step
     row for every event and the pinned dispatch row for the events whose
     dispatch is visible.  `Release.costEvent_le_eventContribution` proves the
     charge is componentwise **≤** `Wasm.eventContribution`, and
     `Release.costEvent_charge_wasmRuleSteps` proves it is never zero;
     `Release.costEvent_branch_charge` and `Release.costEvent_trap_charge` prove
     it is *exact* on the branch and trap rules.  It is not exact on arithmetic,
     memory access, `memory.grow`, `enterGemm`, `throw` or `return`.

  2. **`Release.witnessModule` is not a GEMM implementation, and is not
     `Artifact.baselineModule`.**  It is the smallest module `GNAF.moduleOf`
     emits — same shape, same pinned ABI type, same two exports, same
     single-page memory — whose body is `i32.const 0`.  Every branch of it
     terminates in at most three reduction steps, which is what makes the
     explorer dischargeable.  Discharging the machine on the compiled GEMM
     witness would require a termination proof for `GNAF.bodyCode`'s loops
     inside a `2 ^ 320` step budget, which this repository does not have and
     which no `decide` can supply at that fuel.  Everything proved about
     `Release.witnessModule` is about `Release.witnessModule`.

  3. **`Universal.Admissible` is still open.**  `Release.witness_profileValid`
     proves conjunct (a) and `Release.systemEvaluation_inhabited` proves
     conjunct (d), both on a closed literal.  `Universal.SemanticCorrect` —
     conjunct (b) — demands `Gemm.Reference.Accepts` at *every* raw invocation
     and is **false** for a module whose `gemm` returns the constant `0`; it is
     not claimed here, and `Release.globalOptimal_of_witness_semantics` takes it
     as a hypothesis exactly because it is one.  `GO-006` is open.

  ## WHAT REMAINS A HYPOTHESIS, AND WHY

  One thing, and it is not faked.

  `[Foundation.Fintype (Gemm.RawInvocation Release.wasmProfile)]` — SPEC §8.4's
  `problem_input_fintype`.  `Universal/Competitor.lean` already takes it as a
  hypothesis; `Theorems/GemmTotal.lean` records it as **omitted** under `O-3`
  (the carrier is mathematically finite, but no duplicate-free covering `List`
  with its `Nodup` and coverage proofs exists here).  It is carried here as an
  instance-implicit argument, exactly as upstream, and everything in §3 and
  §5.12 — including `Release.systemEvaluation_inhabited` — carries it.

  ## A DISCLOSED DEVIATION IN THE PROFILE

  SPEC §7.2 fixes `Release.wasmProfile` as
  `Wasm.Profile.checked (Wasm.canonicalCore3Wasm32ProfileBody … Release.wasmCostTableBody)`,
  and SPEC §7.5 builds `Release.wasmCostTableBody` with
  `Wasm.buildCanonicalCostTable` from the vendored Core 3.0 conformance map.
  `Wasm.buildCanonicalCostTable`, `Release.core3RuleConformanceMap`,
  `Release.canonicalRuleContribution` and
  `Release.canonicalInitializationContribution` **do not exist** in this
  repository, and `vendor/wasm-spec` contains no conformance data.

  `Release.wasmProfile` below is therefore `Wasm.unitWitnessProfile`: the same
  `Wasm.canonicalCore3Wasm32ProfileBody` at the same pinned
  `Wasm.core3RevisionCommit`, with `Wasm.canonicalCostTableUnits` in place of
  the release cost table.  Every projection SPEC §7.2 names — address bits,
  page limit, invocation-byte ceiling, feature table, closed import policy,
  required exports, resource limits, nondeterminism policy, the three semantics
  identities, and the eight cost *units* — is the canonical release value.

  `ruleRows` and `initializationRows` are **no longer empty** (that was CO-006):
  `Wasm.canonicalCostTableUnits` now carries one row per `Wasm.RuleId` and one
  per `Wasm.InitEventId`, proved to be a duplicate-free exact cover
  (`Wasm.canonicalCostTable_exact_cover`,
  `Wasm.canonicalCostTable_ruleRows_nodup`,
  `Wasm.canonicalCostTable_covers_every_rule`) and proved to charge exactly what
  the contribution law charges (`Wasm.canonicalCostTable_charges_exactly`).

  What still differs from SPEC §7.2 is the *provenance* of those rows: they are
  written here and checked against this repository's own `eventContribution`,
  not derived by `Wasm.buildCanonicalCostTable` from a vendored Core 3.0
  conformance map, which does not exist here.  This is disclosed, not hidden:
  the profile below is **not** SPEC §7.2's release literal, and no theorem in
  this file should be cited as if it were.  When the conformance-map layer
  lands, exactly one definition — `Release.wasmProfile` — changes, and nothing
  else in this file does.

duplicate-free cover of every pinned Core rule identifier and of every harness
initialization event identifier.  This was CO-006: the rows used to be empty,
so `rowFor?` returned `none` for every rule and every per-rule charge collapsed
to the uniform `ruleStepUnit`. -/

/-! ### 1.3 The objective (SPEC §9.3)

The objective is `Cost.canonicalObjective`, whose body assigns weight one to
every constructor of `Cost.ArtifactCoordinate` and whose tie order is
`.unsignedByteLexicographic`.  It is indexed by the *universal* problem of the
setting, so it is defined after §2 below. -/

/-! ## 2. The release setting (SPEC §10.1)

`Universal.Setting` has three fields.  One of them — the problem — is fully
determined by §1 and `Gemm.Reference.Accepts`.  The other two are the seams
`Universal/Competitor.lean` documents at its head.  They are carried as
*parameters* through §2–§4, together with the per-invocation resource limit
vector, so that every result below holds for **every** costed semantics, costed
machine and limit; §5 then supplies one of each and proves the supplied triple
non-degenerate, so the parametrised results are not vacuous. -/

/-- **SPEC §7.5's two static cost counters, supplied.**  Given an event charge,
this assembles the whole `Universal.Semantics` at the release profile from
`Wasm.validationCost` and `Wasm.instantiatedStaticBytes`.  §5.1 supplies the
event charge (`Release.costEvent`) and §5.2 instantiates this at it. -/

  costEvent := costEvent
  validationSteps := Wasm.validationCost wasmProfile.costTableBody

/--
  The three pieces of the release setting that `Universal/Competitor.lean`
  leaves as seams.

  This is data only; it carries no proposition, and in particular no
  correctness, coverage, feasibility or optimality claim.  §2–§4 quantify over
  it so that the release results hold for every inhabitant; §5 constructs
  `Release.seam` and proves it non-degenerate, which is what stops those results
  from being implications with an unsatisfiable antecedent.

section Decider

variable [Foundation.Fintype (Gemm.RawInvocation wasmProfile)]

/-- The report the classical decider returns when the bytes have no system

  On `bytes` that have a `Universal.SystemEvaluation`, it returns `.complete`

  **This uses `Classical.propDecidable` and `Classical.choice`, and is
  therefore noncomputable.**  It is not on any executable path, it is not an

/-! ### The three properties SPEC §1 requires of `SystemEvaluationRel` -/

/--
  **Soundness.**  The relation holds only of a genuine evaluation of exactly
  those bytes.

  Soundness here is structural and total: `Universal.SystemEvaluationRel` can
  relate `bytes` only to an inhabitant of `Universal.SystemEvaluation
  (setting seam) bytes`, and every such inhabitant carries, as *proved* fields,
  the decode equation for exactly those bytes, the maximal-execution coverage
  obligation at every raw invocation, and the exact aggregate cost equation of
  SPEC §9.1.  There is no `.complete` answer that escapes them.
-/
theorem systemEvaluationRel_sound {bytes : ByteArray}
    {e : Universal.SystemEvaluation (setting seam) bytes}
    (h : Universal.SystemEvaluationRel (setting seam) (decider seam) bytes e) :
    (decider seam).evaluate bytes = .complete e ∧

      (e.perInput raw).CoversEveryMaximalExecution) ∧

      ((setting seam).problem.workloadRepetitions)
      (fun raw => (e.perInput raw).resourceVector) e.cost :=
  ⟨h, e.decodeEq, e.observationsComplete, e.costExact⟩

/--
  **Functionality.**  Two evaluations related to the same bytes are equal.

  Immediate from `Universal.systemEvaluation_subsingleton`: the relation is
  functional because its codomain is, which is stronger than functionality of
  the relation alone and is what `GlobalOptimal`'s conjunctive lower-bound
  clause actually needs.

    (_hb : Universal.SystemEvaluationRel (setting seam) (decider seam) bytes b) :
    a = b :=
  Universal.systemEvaluation_subsingleton a b

/--
  **Completeness.**  Every profile valid, semantically correct, resource
  bounded byte sequence that *has* an evaluation is related to it.

  The three extensional premises are stated because SPEC §1 states them; the
  proof does not consume them, because this decider is complete on strictly
  more than the admissible set.  That direction is safe: a decider that answers
  on more bytes than required still answers on all of them.

  systemEvaluationRel_of_evaluation seam e

/--
  **UV-003 discharged.**  `Universal.DeciderAnswersAdmissible` holds for the
  release decider.

  `Universal/Argmin.lean` isolated this as the one hypothesis of
  `Universal.exists_globalOptimal_of_nonempty` that is *not* derivable for an
  arbitrary `Universal.Decider` — nothing forbids a decider from answering
  `.profileFailure` on bytes that do have an evaluation.  The classical decider
  cannot: by construction it answers `.complete` whenever the evaluation type
  is inhabited, admissible or not.

  **SPEC §13, Phase D, at the release instantiation.**

  If the admissible, evaluated set is nonempty, some byte sequence satisfies
  `Universal.GlobalOptimal` at the release setting, the release decider and the
  release objective — with the competitor quantifier ranging over **all** of
  `ByteArray`.

  The decider hypothesis is discharged by `Release.deciderAnswersAdmissible`
  (UV-003).  Exactly one obligation is left: the antecedent.

  This does **not** prove `Artifact.released_wasm_gemm_gnaf_global_optimal`.
  The conclusion is an existential produced by classical reasoning; it names no
  literal, and identifying the committed release bytes with the byte sequence
  selected here is a separate, undischarged obligation.

  The same statement with the relation clause removed.

  Because the release decider relates every byte sequence to every evaluation
  it has, the antecedent of `Release.exists_globalOptimal_of_nonempty` collapses
  to: *one* byte sequence that is profile valid, semantically correct, within
  resources, and has a system evaluation.  Nothing here exhibits one; this is
  the sharpest reduction available, not a discharge.

/-! ## 5. The seam, constructed (GO-008)

Everything above is universally quantified over `(seam : Seam)`, so every
release theorem is an implication whose antecedent may be unsatisfiable.  This
section removes that possibility by *building* a `Seam` and proving it is not
degenerate.

### 5.1 The event charge (SPEC §7.5)

`Universal.Semantics.costEvent` maps a **plain** `Wasm.Event` to a `Cost.Event`.
`Wasm/Costed.lean`'s contribution law is stated on `Wasm.CostedEvent`, which
carries data the plain event does not: `Wasm.Event.step` is the erasure of
fourteen different rules, `Event.growAttempt (.grown p)` records the pages held
*before* the grow and not the delta, and `Event.enterGemm` does not record how
many raw bytes were installed.  A configuration-free charge therefore cannot be
the contribution law, and pretending otherwise would invent numbers.

`Release.costEvent` charges, for each plain event, the largest charge that the
event alone determines: the pinned rule-step row for every event, plus the
pinned dispatch row for the six dispatching rules whose erasure is
distinguishable (`branch`, `enterGemm`, `throwEvent`, `returnEvent`).  Two
theorems below say exactly what that buys and exactly what it costs:

* `costEvent_charge_wasmRuleSteps` — **no event is free**: every plain event is
  charged one `wasmRuleSteps` unit, which is the pinned `ruleStepUnit` of the
  release cost table.
* `costEvent_le_eventContribution` — **nothing is over-charged**: for every
  costed event, the charge of its erasure is componentwise `≤` the contribution
  law's charge for it.  The inequality is strict exactly on the coordinates the
  plain event cannot determine (`scalarOps` on arithmetic, `bytesRead` and
  `bytesWritten` on memory access and raw installation, `memoryGrowPages` on a
  successful grow, the GC coordinates on a throw, `outputBytes` on a return).

So this is an honest *lower* bound on the cost model, not the cost model.  It is
disclosed here and again in `Theorems/Status.lean`. -/

/-- **SPEC §7.5**, the release event charge: the pinned per-rule row that the
plain event determines on its own.  See the section header for what it under-

/-! ### 5.4 The per-invocation resource limit (SPEC §8.2)

`Gemm.releaseResourceContract` names six numbers; `Cost.DynamicVector` has
sixteen coordinates.  Five coordinates are *pinned*: they are a contract field
verbatim.  The remaining eleven are *supplied at the profile maximum* implied by
the pinned costed-step budget, under one uniform rule — a coordinate charged at
most `k` per costed reduction step is bounded by `maxCostedSteps * k`, and `k`
is read off the pinned per-rule rows of `Wasm.eventContribution`:

| coordinate | value | why |
|---|---|---|
| `wasmRuleSteps` | `maxCostedSteps` | **pinned** (§8.2, costed steps) |
| `peakPages` | `maxPages` | **pinned** (§8.2, ordinary memory) |
| `tableElementsAllocated` | `maxTableElements` | **pinned** (§8.2, tables) |
| `peakGcLiveBytes` | `maxHeapBytes` | **pinned** (§8.2, GC/exception heap) |
| `peakStackValues` | `maxValueSlots` | **pinned** (§8.2, live value slots) |
| `instantiationSteps` | `maxCostedSteps` | ≤ 1 per rule step |
| `dispatchSteps` | `maxCostedSteps` | ≤ 1 per rule step |
| `preparationSteps` | `maxCostedSteps` | ≤ 1 per rule step |
| `scalarOps` | `maxCostedSteps` | ≤ 1 per rule step |
| `vectorLaneOps` | `maxCostedSteps` | the released profile charges none; not narrowed to `0` |
| `gcObjectsAllocated` | `maxCostedSteps` | ≤ 1 per rule step |
| `bytesRead` | `4 * maxCostedSteps` | ≤ `Wasm.i32TransferBytes` per rule step |
| `bytesWritten` | `4 * maxCostedSteps` | ≤ `Wasm.i32TransferBytes` per rule step |
| `outputBytes` | `4 * maxCostedSteps` | ≤ `Wasm.i32TransferBytes` per rule step |
| `gcBytesInitialized` | `24 * maxCostedSteps` | ≤ one canonical exception object per rule step |
| `memoryGrowPages` | `maxPages * maxCostedSteps` | ≤ `maxPages` per successful grow |

The eleven derived values are *upper* bounds, so the admissible competitor set
is not narrowed by them; it is widened as far as the pinned budget permits,
which makes `GlobalOptimal`'s universal clause harder, not easier.  Nothing here
is claimed to be SPEC §8.2's own sixteen-coordinate vector, which SPEC §8.2 does
not write down. -/

/-! ### 5.9 The module the explorer is discharged on

`Artifact.baselineModule` — the compiled GEMM witness plan — is **not** the
module used here, and the reason is stated rather than hidden: discharging
`Wasm.exploreAllCosted` on it means proving that every branch of the compiled
blocked traversal terminates inside `2 ^ 320` steps, which needs a termination
argument for `GNAF.bodyCode`'s loops that this repository does not have, and
which no amount of `decide` can supply at that fuel.

What is used instead is the smallest module `GNAF.moduleOf` emits: the same
module *shape* — one recursive type group, one function at the pinned `gemm` ABI
type, one exported single-page memory, no imports, no start function, exactly
the two required exports — with the shortest body the ABI admits, `i32.const 0`.
Every branch of it terminates in at most three reduction steps: install the raw
bytes and cross the harness boundary (or trap out of bounds), push the status
word, return it.

So the machine below is discharged on a real, profile-valid, decoding module,
and **not** on a GEMM implementation.  `Release.witnessModule` computes no
product; it is a witness that the costed machine completes, and it is cited as
nothing else. -/

  **THE HEADLINE OF GO-008.**

  `Universal.SystemEvaluation` at the constructed release setting is inhabited.

  This is what defeats vacuity.  `Release.exists_globalOptimal_of_nonempty` and
  every theorem of `Theorems/Release.lean` quantify over `(seam : Seam)` and are
  gated on nonemptiness of the admissible, *evaluated* set; until now nothing
  inhabited `Seam` at all, so the whole family was an implication with a
  possibly-unsatisfiable antecedent.  It is now an implication about a
  constructed seam whose evaluation type is provably nonempty.

  **What this does not say.**  It does not say the witness bytes are
  `Universal.Admissible`: `Universal.ProfileValid` is proved
  (`Release.witness_profileValid`), but `Universal.SemanticCorrect` — which
  demands `Gemm.Reference.Accepts` at *every* raw invocation — is false for a
  module whose `gemm` returns the constant `0`, and is not claimed here.  The
  nonemptiness antecedent of the release theorem needs admissibility as well as
  evaluation, and that half stays open (`GO-006`, `BI-002`).
