# The model, end to end

UOR-R4 turns text into whole-number token ids, carries those ids through geometric state and exact
memory, and chooses the next token without softmax or dense matrix multiplication. **M1 is
complete**: a saved discrete model passed all six bars on two seeds. No model holds a useful
conversation. Two model paths exist and have not joined: the discrete M1 path and the float-trained
FBS trunk.

![The current two-path pipeline: the saved discrete model reaching its integer export, and the separate float-trained FBS trunk working toward complete replies.](../figures/model/pipeline.svg)

*The discrete M1 artifact and the FBS research line are different models, not one joined pipeline.*

Labels follow [`docs/formal_vocabulary.md`](../formal_vocabulary.md): **proof**, **measurement**,
**hypothesis**. A construction control is not a language result, and `NOT_RUN` is never a pass.

## The discrete path that closed M1

The saved artifact is `trunk-joint-pointer-v1-d11`, a 19-table `uor-r4.lut-discrete-trunk/1`
`UORLUT01` model. Its composition is Flock `FrozenZeroV1`, a discrete Hamilton gate, discrete
quaternion recurrence, a four-block orbit-root causal pointer, and post-rotation outer-L1 readout.

| Stage | Mechanism and representation | State at the M1 close |
|---|---|---|
| Tokenizer | Byte-level BPE, 4,096 pieces, identity `d36d3e87` | Fixed and pinned to corpora, panels and artifacts |
| Token table | Shared input/carry/output vector table; exact token identity stays separate from geometric address | Trained |
| Ordered context | At most 243 positions; recorded runs use 192 | Built and used |
| Reads | Flock read and orbit-root causal pointer using hard selection, not softmax | Trained in the M1 composition; Route and Relation are other discrete mechanisms, not isolated by this whole-model pass |
| Writer and admission | 16×16 address cells; bounded candidate shortlist before nearest-token choice | Trained; full 19-table export carries the final readout |
| Objective and learning | Integer rank-margin hinge and discrete legal moves, including BVG-K batched verified coordinates | Trained; produced the saved model |
| Position | Discrete quaternion recurrence and `PositionHolonomyV1` | Trained in the M1 composition |
| Normalization | `OrbitRootSnapNormV1` | Trained in the M1 composition; discrete normalization, not the FBS RMS norm |
| Feed-forward | Discrete Hamilton gate | Trained in the M1 composition |
| Position and normalization on the separate FBS path | SpiralCore transport spin and RMS norm with integer square root | FBS-only; not M1's projection or normalization mechanism |
| Export | Table-native `uor-r4.lut-discrete-trunk/1` | Exact 14,287-row agreement and B4 pass |
| Serving | D11 integer engine on an Apple M1 | 10,876 / 10,566 decode tok/s under the bar-f protocol |

## What the saved model measured

| Panel/contract | Seed 1 | Seed 2 | Controls |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| DEV integer top-1 | **7,002 / 14,287** | **7,001 / 14,287** | unigram 1,226; T2 6,300 |
| Fresh V2 integer top-1 | **7,215 / 14,479** | **7,228 / 14,479** | unigram 1,279; T2 6,582 |
| p-f held-out phrasing | **7,850 / 15,953** | **7,872 / 15,953** | unigram 1,409; T2 7,375; band 81 |

The older close grade covers bars (a)–(e); claude-211's panel score supplies bar (f). p-f has no
prompt value-masked templates in TRAIN at K = 1,024, but **62.5% of its reference replies are
verbatim TRAIN replies**. M1 therefore shows reading new prompt phrasings into known reply kinds,
not new reply kinds or useful conversation
([closing report](../loop/tasks/m1-heldout-phrasing-transfer/claude-211/REPORT.md)).

## The separate float-trained FBS trunk

The FBS path trains offline in float under D37 and exports to integer D11. It is not the M1 model.

| Step | Part | Mechanism and current state |
|---|---|---|
| Token | Byte-level BPE, 4,096 pieces | Done |
| → vector | Learned FBS table, 4,096 × 256 | Trained and served |
| → vector | Position | SpiralCore transport spin, trained and served; no RoPE |
| → vector | Mixing | FBS recurrence, Hamilton gate and SpiralCore/FBS routes, exact under `lut-stack/5` |
| → vector | Copy/look-back | Hamming read and copy heads; integer kernels exist, full joined serving remains open |
| → vector | Storage | Exact turn memory keyed by the turn's exact first token ids; strong on familiar DEV prompts, weak on new phrasing |
| → vector | Feed-forward and norm | Hamilton gate and RMS norm with integer square root, served |
| → integer | Export | `lut-stack/5` inside the export-gap bar at DEV scope |
| → token | Readout | Whole-table nearest chosen; the joined served session is not complete |
| Text in/out | R7 and accepted-model text/chat distribution | Open |

**Current failure and latest probe.** Claude-217's cycle and echo steps end every registered loop,
but content is underpowered and greedy remains the decode. On p-s, reply openings are 17.4%, 13.7%
and 18.6% at three seeds, against 80.8%, 80.2% and 79.9% on later tokens. Exact-reference replies
are only 3, 1 and 4 of 256, and exact-key memory finds little on new phrasing
([claude-217](../loop/tasks/one-model-end-to-end/claude-217/REPORT.md)). Claude-218 found
trunk-state keys offline; [claude-219](../loop/tasks/one-model-end-to-end/claude-219/REPORT.md)
then tested them in free generation on fresh p-v. The point-key opening improves templates by
+13/+8/+12 and exact replies by +9/+8/+12 at three seeds, but only partially. The sign key is
inconclusive at this panel size. [Claude-220](../loop/tasks/one-model-end-to-end/claude-220/REPORT.md) then served the point key inside one float model on fresh p-w: templates improve by +41/+40/+42 at three seeds with exact claude-219 parity, while recalling TRAIN replies rather than generalizing. [Claude-222](../loop/tasks/point-key-integer/claude-222/REPORT.md) has built the integer point table, search and `/8` record, with 380 library tests and a full serving audit. [Claude-224](../loop/tasks/point-key-integer/claude-224/REPORT.md) has built the panel decode and grade. Before unit 3's real TRAIN export, p-x scoring and laptop measurement, [integer-retention-rates](../roadmap/items/integer-retention-rates.md) must make the integer recurrence match the trained model; useful chat remains unproven.

## What remains unbuilt or unqualified

- **M2 and M3:** complete correct replies and durable memory, not just next-token scores.
- **M4:** the accepted model's full `UORLUT01` export, quality, session and audit path. A lawful
  likelihood (`PRLL`) exists, but GPU held-out scoring remains open.
- **A joined model:** the discrete M1 path and FBS trunk do not share a table, trunk or served session.
- **M5:** whole-path latency, memory traffic and energy; arithmetic counts alone do not establish them.
- **M7:** library/CLI/browser parity on the accepted model, not only a synthetic stand-in.
- **Learned address formation:** the true-address 80/80 oracle is exact-read evidence, not proof
  that the model has learned to form addresses or earned M3.

## Historical K16, kept in scope

K16-A scored 65 and 463 of 14,287, below unigram 1,226 and T2 6,300. K16-R collapsed to 19 or 20
occupied cells. Those negative configurations remain important evidence, but they predate the M1
close. The older address-key, read, ranking and schedule hypotheses belong to that history; they do
not erase the later saved model's result ([K16 outcome](../labs/k16-outcome-call-2026-10-19/README.md)).
