# ADR-0003: Use fixed-zeta prime routes for geometric attention

- **Status:** Accepted for bounded G1R implementation; not product-promoted
- **Date:** 2026-08-26
- **Decision owner:** representation redesign
  [#958](https://github.com/UOR-Foundation/uor-r4/issues/958)
- **Programme tracker:**
  [#949](https://github.com/UOR-Foundation/uor-r4/issues/949)
- **Supersedes:** the learned query/key/value replacement selected by
  [ADR-0002](0002-geometric-causal-decoder.md), after the negative #951
  qualification. ADR-0002 remains the historical record for G0 and G1.

## Context

G0 established a reachable layer-29 seam and a coherent source-model control.
G1 then established that the learned four-coordinate mixer could move bounded
support and persistent-memory probability, but its operator-alignment and
sampled-token terms remained effectively flat. The predeclared verdict was
`REDESIGN_REPRESENTATION`, not all-layer promotion.

The failed representation also departed from the original router's intended
mechanism. The original mechanism used a fixed grid of non-trivial zeta-zero
ordinates, prime-mapped data, factor overlap, R4/Hopf state, and torsion/phase
transport. Geometry supplied storage, recall, and steering; bigram/trigram
tables or an external Ollama model still supplied fluent continuation. It did
not establish standalone attention or reasoning.

The surviving Prime Router implementation contains two important analytical
pieces:

1. a windowed Chebyshev residual `psi(x) - x`, where the distributional
   derivative of `psi` is the von Mangoldt signal; and
2. projection onto fixed log-polar phases `exp(i * gamma_j * log(x))`.

Under the Riemann-hypothesis assumption, a critical zero has
`rho_j = 1/2 + i*gamma_j`, so

```text
x^rho_j = sqrt(x) * exp(i * gamma_j * log(x)).
```

This explains both the square-root window scale and the immutable angular
grid. **Assumption:** this architecture may assume RH as a coordinate-design
axiom. It does not claim to prove RH or to make product correctness depend on
RH being proved.

## Decision

Replace the learned layer-29 query/key representation with a factorable,
content-addressed route representation and bounded direct lookup. The source
model remains a teacher and transitional behavioral control; it is not the
definition of the serving geometry.

### 1. Fixed grid and local polar derivative

Let `gamma_j` be an ordinate in the immutable zeta-grid manifest. For prime
atom `p`, define the angular channel

```text
theta_j(p) = wrap(gamma_j * log(p)).
```

For consecutive prime atoms, the local angular derivative is

```text
delta_theta_j(n)
  = wrap(theta_j(p_(n+1)) - theta_j(p_n))
  = wrap(gamma_j * log(p_(n+1) / p_n)).
```

Writing the prime gap as `g_n = p_(n+1) - p_n` gives the small-gap
approximation

```text
delta_theta_j(n) ~= gamma_j * g_n / p_n.
```

The exact log-ratio form is the compiler/reference definition. A compiled
phase-delta table is the intended runtime realization. The runtime updates the
entering and leaving factors; it does not recompute every absolute prefix
coordinate.

The radial signal is separately declared. The first reference candidate is
the square-root-normalized Chebyshev residual

```text
r(x) = (psi(x) - x) / sqrt(x).
```

A divisor-count radial alternative may be tested, but it must not silently
replace `r(x)`: for a square-free `k`-prime n-let, `tau(N) = 2^k` mostly
records context length rather than semantic position.

### 2. Prime atoms, semiprime experts, and n-let context

Each compiled route atom has a registered prime `p_t`. A transition expert is

```text
e_t = p_(t-1) * p_t.
```

The base expert gate requires a square-free semiprime:

```text
rad(e_t) = e_t, omega(e_t) = Omega(e_t) = 2.
```

In the non-degenerate case, consecutive experts expose their handoff without
a global scan:

```text
gcd(e_t, e_(t+1)) = p_t.
```

A length-`k` context is an n-let product

```text
N_t = product(p_(t-r), r=0..k-1).
```

The commutative product is a locality and factor-overlap key, not a complete
ordered identity. Repeated factors and route direction are preserved by the
ordered route record, spin/torsion state, and its canonical kappa.

### 3. S3 compute state and S2 observation

The local non-zero R4 state is normalized onto `S3` and represented as a pair
of complex coordinates:

```text
(z1, z2) = (cos(chi) * exp(i*theta1), sin(chi) * exp(i*theta2)),
|z1|^2 + |z2|^2 = 1.
```

The Hopf observation is the `S2` point

```text
h(z1,z2) = (
  2*Re(z1*conj(z2)),
  2*Im(z1*conj(z2)),
  |z1|^2 - |z2|^2
).
```

Thus `S3` is the compute/spin manifold in R4, while `S2` embedded in R3 is the
observable or heatmap-like projection. The common `S1` fiber phase is not
discarded from storage: it is retained as torsion/transport state so projection
does not destroy route identity.

The 512-channel zeta amplitude vector is a separate spectral heatmap. It must
not be conflated with one four-coordinate `S3` state. A declared compression or
selection operator binds the spectral heatmap to the local R4 state.

### 4. Typed zero/identity bridge

The architecture deliberately distinguishes two uses of `0^0`:

```text
continuous_null(0^0) = 0
discrete_empty_product(0^0) = 1.
```

This is a typed domain bridge, not an assertion that ordinary untyped
arithmetic gives both values simultaneously. The bridge mode is part of the
canonical state and therefore changes its kappa.

The useful ternary landmarks remain

```text
exp(i*pi)          = -1
exp(i*pi) + pi^0   =  0
pi^0               = +1.
```

For a phase `theta`, the proposed collapse gate is

```text
activation(theta) = sin(theta)^2,
chirality(theta)  = sign(sin(theta)).
```

It gives activation `1` at `sin(theta) = +/-1, cos(theta) = 0` and activation
`0` at `sin(theta) = 0`. Chirality retains the `-1/0/+1` orientation that
squaring alone would erase. If the two `sin(theta)=0` antipodes must remain
distinct, `sign(cos(theta))` is retained as an additional polarity bit.

### 5. Direction-preserving golden radial bridge

The discrete complex state and its R4 realization preserve direction. Using
the ordinary identification `E : C^2 -> R4`, define the complex-to-Riemannian
lift

```text
R_phi(z) = phi * E(z),
phi = (1 + sqrt(5)) / 2.
```

For every non-zero state,

```text
normalize(R_phi(z)) = normalize(E(z)),
||R_phi(z)|| / ||E(z)|| = phi.
```

The inverse chart scales by `phi^-1`. Thus angle, prime direction, and Hopf
sector remain invariant across the bridge; only the radial shell changes. This
is a similarity transform chosen by the architecture, not a claim that the
ordinary `C^2 ~= R4` identification itself changes norm.

Golden radial values can be represented exactly in the quadratic integer ring
`Z[phi]`. Store a radius as the coefficient pair `(a,b)` meaning `a + b*phi`.
Then a complex-to-Riemannian radial step needs integer addition only:

```text
(a,b) * phi     -> (b, a+b)
(a,b) * phi^-1  -> (b-a, a).
```

Repeated shell changes therefore follow the Fibonacci recurrence without a
runtime floating multiply. The shell exponent, coefficient pair, direction,
and conversion orientation are bound into the manifest.

The values `sqrt(2)`, `2i`, and `[0,2]` remain related metric landmarks rather
than the radial conversion itself. For unit states `u,v`,

```text
d_chord(u,v) = ||u-v|| = 2*sin(d_geodesic(u,v)/2),
d_chord in [0,2].
```

Orthogonal unit states have chord distance `sqrt(2)`. Antipodal complex states
`i` and `-i` have displacement `2i` and chord magnitude `2`. The raw geodesic
distance is in `[0,pi]`; if a Riemannian score is reported in `[0,2]`, its
normalization or use of chord distance must be explicit.

Compiler code may choose the cheapest faithful chart. A promoted deployed path
must use the exact `Z[phi]` shell update where applicable plus canonical angular
quantization and lookup tables. Its chart, scale direction, and error bounds
must be bound into the artifact rather than switching arithmetic implicitly.

The choice is operation-local and deterministic:

```text
factor, gcd, cardinality       -> discrete prime chart
log-phase delta, conjugation   -> complex chart or compiled phase table
spin, Hopf, torsion transport  -> S3/R4 chart or compiled transition table
distance/ranking               -> cheapest certified integer/table metric
```

For operation `op` and equivalent chart implementations `C(op)`, the normative
compiler will select

```text
chart(op) = argmin(cost(c, target), c in C(op) and fidelity(c) passes),
```

using a versioned target-specific cost profile and canonical tie-break. Every
promoted conversion witness must check preserved direction, the declared `phi`
radial shell change, quantization error, and round-trip identity where the
transform is intended to be reversible. The selected chart, cost-profile CID,
and witness must be kappa-bound. Runtime input must not choose a cheaper but
semantically different arithmetic convention.

### 6. Geometry is the route and the route addresses data

The promoted compiled spin manifest must bind at least:

- zeta-grid CID and revision;
- prime-registry CID and atom-to-prime assignments;
- semiprime expert and n-let overlap tables;
- ordered route keys for last-one, last-two, and sentence contexts;
- R4 spin, Hopf base, fiber phase, torsion, holonomy, and refinement path;
- direction-preserving `Z[phi]` radial shell and complex/Riemannian chart;
- payload CIDs rather than duplicated payload bytes where appropriate;
- tokenizer/corpus/compiler provenance;
- typed bridge conventions and quantization profile; and
- full canonical kappa and rebuild witness.

The factorable geometric address is intended to supply locality. Kappa supplies
exact identity and integrity. Raw kappa bits, hexadecimal spelling, MAC bytes,
or an IPv6-shaped serialization do not define semantic neighborhood.

### SpiralCore v63 compatibility boundary

The local SpiralCore v63 reference, SHA-256
`3f8e6a98186999cca6c55ea42cd8b496935837c2987379f39e8e659b56360215`,
is accepted as a source-free reference candidate, not as semantic-attention
evidence. This decision comes from a static audit. Its embedded JavaScript
fixtures are `NOT_RUN` here because the available browser refuses local
`file://` pages; the page's reported fixture results are therefore claims to
reproduce independently, not evidence imported into this repository.

SpiralCore v63 itself contains no prime-address construction; the following
prime-slot correspondence is this ADR's proposed adapter. For a canonically
selected, ordered, manifest-bound sextet of distinct prime atoms
`(p0,...,p5)`, the fifteen square-free semiprime experts `p_i*p_j` can
share the same unordered-pair index as the fifteen `Cl(0,6)` bivectors
`B_ij = L_i L_j`. Unique factorization then gives the Johnson graph `J(6,2)`:
two experts are adjacent exactly when their GCD is one of the six carrier
primes. The semiprime identifies an unoriented plane; ordered route state and
torsion retain direction. A reverse-step convention may use
`B_ji = -B_ij = B_ij^3`, but its basis, orientation, and causal effect must be
kappa-bound and tested.

A compiled 64-state operator accumulator may be evaluated as bounded holonomy
metadata. It cannot replace ordered route identity because distinct histories
collide into those 64 states. The standard-coordinate E8 root action remains a
separate eight-dimensional test plane, not R4, H4, `S3`, or the Hopf `S2`
observation. Bell MF is an optional pair codec and observability layer. The RFC
3849 IPv6 form is a reversible presentation for constrained symbolic fields;
it is neither a semantic locator nor a carrier for a full 256-bit kappa.

No operator path is promoted until an exact deterministic Rust reproduction
binds the Fano convention, generator order, left/right action, matrices, root
ordering, and transition tables. Sextet selection and chart rollover must be
defined before corpus use, and a causal intervention must beat factor-only and
permuted-slot controls. This bounded port follows the passed current-substrate
worker canary; it does not widen or authorize a corpus-scale run.

### 7. Geometric attention

The promoted compiled artifact must provide three causal indexes:

```text
I1[last_route]                    -> bounded next-route candidates
I2[previous_route, last_route]    -> bounded next-route candidates
IS[ordered_sentence_route_key]    -> bounded continuation candidates
```

Candidate support must be the bounded union of those rows plus declared
divisor-overlap and adjacent-spin fallbacks. Selection must minimize a declared
integer/table-backed energy over factor overlap, prime-gap phase derivative,
S3 transport continuity, S2 observable compatibility, torsion, and compiled
continuation evidence. No learned dense Q/K projection and no scan of all
prefix or corpus positions is permitted in this path.

### 8. Attention is not yet reasoning

This ADR specifies the representation and candidate-selection boundary only.
Once implemented and qualified, attention will identify locally relevant next
routes. Reasoning additionally requires bounded multi-step route composition
toward a goal, preservation of intermediate constraints, branch comparison,
and a closure or contradiction test. That mechanism receives its own measured
stage after one-step and sentence-route attention is causally established.
Fluent output inherited from source weights or an external model is not
evidence that geometric reasoning exists.

## Current implementation status

ADR-0003 remains the normative target. The current #958 code is deliberately a
source-free substrate and does not establish geometric attention or product
behavior.

| Component | Status | Current evidence boundary |
|---|---|---|
| Typed bridge; prime, square-free semiprime, n-let/GCD, zeta-delta, S3/Hopf/fiber/torsion, and exact `Z[phi]` algebra | `IMPLEMENTED_SUBSTRATE` | Source-free types and focused tests only. |
| Incremental ordered sentence-route identity and exact bounded I1/I2/IS construction/lookup | `IMPLEMENTED_SUBSTRATE` | Direct exact-key count rows; no divisor/spin expansion or least-energy selection. |
| Hard tiny-canary limits and deterministic whole-sentence partitioning | `IMPLEMENTED_SUBSTRATE` | Compiler refuses corpus-shaped inputs through its public compile API. |
| Per-worker partition/completion/elapsed and peak-active instrumentation | `IMPLEMENTED_SUBSTRATE` | Operational metadata only; excluded from semantic bytes and kappa. |
| ADR-defined six-prime `J(6,2)` indexing over SpiralCore v63's `Cl(0,6)` structure | `NOT_YET_IMPLEMENTED` | Static compatibility audit only; v63 contains no prime/GCD route, embedded page fixtures are `NOT_RUN`, and no manifest-bound Rust operator table exists. |
| Complete semiprime/n-let manifest tables, chart/quantization binding, and canonical conversion/rebuild witnesses | `NOT_YET_IMPLEMENTED` | The current manifest binds only the preliminary exact-index substrate. |
| Divisor-overlap and adjacent-spin fallback, phase/torsion energy, tie-break trace, and selected support | `NOT_YET_IMPLEMENTED` | Exact I1/I2/IS count union is not geometric-attention qualification. |
| Layer-29 caller, equal-budget controls, no-Ollama product probe, and teacher comparison | `NOT_YET_IMPLEMENTED` | No deployed or product capability follows from the substrate. |
| Binding one-worker/four-worker release canary with positive work on every worker and measured four-worker compile-stage improvement | `PASS_SUBSTRATE_SCOPE` | The frozen current-substrate report records 32/32 exact artifact/kappa matches, all four workers active, and 1.498x median compile-stage speedup. The complete manifest is still open and must re-establish this evidence after semantic-input or workload-shape changes. |

## Options considered

### Continue the learned four-coordinate mixer

Rejected. #951 showed support reachability but did not establish useful
semantic-value transport. Continuing to tune it would optimize a representation
that omits the factorable address and fixed-grid mechanism.

### Use kappa, MAC, hexadecimal, or IPv6 bits as geometry

Rejected. MAC is optional hardware provenance, hexadecimal is notation, IPv6
is transport-sized serialization, and a cryptographic digest deliberately
destroys locality. They may bind or carry a route but cannot replace it.

### Recompute similarity against every stored position

Rejected. It leaves the system opaque and superlinear, and ignores the direct
factor and route-context indexes that compilation can provide.

### Fixed-zeta factor route plus local spin transport

Selected. It preserves the original data-as-location invariant, supports local
incremental updates, and admits source-free algebraic tests before any costly
teacher or product run.

## Consequences

- The current learned-mixer redesign code is diagnostic history, not the target
  implementation.
- Corpus text supplies ordered route observations. Source weights may supply
  offline teacher labels and a bounded transitional syntax control, but are not
  stored as the serving route geometry.
- The first implementation is allowed to use compiler-side floating point to
  build and verify tables. Runtime lowering is a separate measured step.
- H4 unit quaternions may provide a discrete spin alphabet in R4. This does not
  identify H4 with E8 or claim that a four-dimensional H4 construction is a
  faithful eight-dimensional E8 representation.
- Every lossy projection declares what is discarded and what the manifest
  retains for reconstruction.
- No hours-long run launches until direct-lookup reachability, deterministic
  rebuild, four-worker scaling, progress/ETA, checkpoint, and distinct decision
  branches pass on a tiny corpus.

## Bounded G1R acceptance order

1. Source-free bridge truth table, semiprime/n-let, GCD handoff, Hopf fiber,
   phase-delta, and chart-conversion tests.
2. Complete canonical manifest and hard worker canary: route order, torsion,
   bridge mode, basis, payload, and provenance changes must change kappa;
   worker count must not. The same tiny corpus must emit byte-identical
   one-worker/four-worker artifacts, all four workers must process non-empty
   partitions, telemetry must report elapsed time and throughput, and four
   workers must improve release-mode wall time. Otherwise stop and profile.
   The current source-free substrate has passed this worker-only portion; the
   complete-manifest portion remains open. Its append-only evidence is
   [`prime_route_worker_canary_958.md`](../prime_route_worker_canary_958.md).
3. Separate source-free operator proof: deterministically reproduce the v63
   Fano convention, six generators, fifteen bivectors, 64-state table, and
   `J(6,2)` correspondence in Rust. Bind every convention and compare against
   factor-only and permuted-slot controls; do not use the E8 display plane as a
   proxy for semantic value. A negative operator result retains the factor-only
   route substrate and does not block testing that mechanism.
4. Causal intervention: last-one, last-two, sentence-route, torsion, and
   phase-delta perturbations must change the declared candidate support or
   ordering without exposing future routes.
5. Bounded no-Ollama product probe comparing the real route indexes with
   equal-budget permuted and count-only controls.
6. Only if those gates pass, one time-bounded source-teacher comparison may be
   run. A negative result preserves the storage/recall substrate without
   promoting geometric attention or reasoning.
