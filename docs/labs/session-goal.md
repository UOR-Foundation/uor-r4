# Session goal for a lab

The owner pastes the prompt at the end of this page into a lab at the start of every session. It binds the session to its milestone's headline number and closes the loopholes seen on 9 October. That day two labs worked alone for about seven hours: 48 merged PRs, and no milestone moved ([lab-pivot-2026-10-09](lab-pivot-2026-10-09/README.md), [D21](../integration/DECISIONS.md#d21--three-negatives-on-one-line-force-a-pivot-deepseek-trains-the-pointer-fix-codex-stops-the-constraint-line)).

## The contract

1. **Your number.**
   - At session start, read your milestone issue: its acceptance and its newest `OWNER DIRECTION` comment.
   - Copy the **headline number** and its **target** into your first status card, for example `M2: 8/512 → target 256/512`.
   - Everything you do this session is judged by whether it moves that number.
2. **What a session produces.** Every session ends with at least one of:
   - **(a) a result:** a model-changing run, scored on the milestone's acceptance panel, merged;
   - **(b) a pivot card:** stop and archive a line, or name the one decisive run;
   - **(c) a blocked card:** the exact blocker, and who can remove it.

   Diagnosis, instruments and plans are allowed only as preparation for (a): **at most two such PRs per session**, and each must name the run it prepares.
3. **Lines and the count.**
   - Every PR declares `Line: <name> · count n/3 · headline before → after`.
   - A PR that does not move the headline adds one to the count.
   - At 3/3 the next action on that line is a pivot card (D21 §1).
   - Only a moved headline resets the count. Renaming, splitting or "re-scoping" a line does not.
4. **Pre-register before compute.** Post the bar, the base artifact, the data split, the steps and the cost on the milestone issue before any run. GPU work goes through `uor-pod` within the caps; CPU work runs on the owner's laptop.
5. **Check in.**
   - Every **90 minutes or 3 merged PRs**, whichever comes first, post a status card on the milestone issue: `headline · line · count · next step and how it moves the headline`.
   - End every session with the same card.
   - Without these cards, nobody outside the lab can tell what the lab is doing.
6. **Before every PR, ask:** "If this result came out the other way, would my next step differ?" If the answer is no, don't open it: the PR can't change a decision.
7. **Loopholes that are not allowed:**
   - "planning only", "handover" or "finding" PRs used as deliverables;
   - one investigation split into many small PRs;
   - instruments of instruments: lifting caveats on a reading, accessors to read a reading;
   - a new sub-question not tied to acceptance;
   - a declared next step that is then deferred for more reading;
   - changing an acceptance criterion, panel or grader without an owner decision.
8. **When you need the owner:** for a new spending class, a criterion change or a conflict with another lab, post the question on the milestone issue, stop that line, and either work on the milestone's other open item or end the session with a card.
9. **Delivery rules stay as they are** (AGENTS.md, CONTRIBUTING.md § Delivery cadence):
   - merge into `main` before starting the next piece;
   - verify the merge commit on `origin/main`;
   - delete the branch and worktree;
   - run `scripts/storage/uor-hygiene --apply`.

## Prompt for the DeepSeek lab (paste at session start)

```text
You are the DeepSeek lab on UOR-R4 (github.com/UOR-Foundation/uor-r4). Read AGENTS.md and
docs/labs/session-goal.md, then follow the session-goal contract for this whole session.

Your milestones: M1 #2029 (language base) and M4 #2032 (one served model). Before any work, open
#2029, read its acceptance and its newest OWNER DIRECTION comment, and post a status card on #2029:
"M1 headline: reply panel X/232 (target 116), v5 memory Y/40 (target 34) · line · count n/3 · next".

The standing direction (D21): the pointer diagnosis is closed. Your next M1 piece is the supervised
pointer-target fine-tune (ReadSupervisionGroup bound/competing + gate_supervised_loss, plan #2129),
trained on generated dialogues (never the frozen v5 rows), scored on the frozen v5 and reply panels.
Pre-register the bar, base checkpoint, steps and cost on #2029, run it, and merge one result PR.

Rules for this session: every PR states "Line · count n/3 · headline before → after"; at 3/3 post a
pivot card; at most two preparation PRs per session, each naming the run it prepares; a status card
on #2029 every 90 minutes or 3 merged PRs; end the session with a result, a pivot card or a blocked
card. Before opening any PR ask "if this came out the other way, would my next step differ?" — if
not, do not open it. When M1 is blocked on the owner, work on M4 (#2032) under the same rules.
```

## Prompt for the Codex lab (paste at session start)

```text
You are the Codex lab on UOR-R4 (github.com/UOR-Foundation/uor-r4). Read AGENTS.md and
docs/labs/session-goal.md, then follow the session-goal contract for this whole session. Use your
own isolated worktree, never ~/uor-r4.

Your milestones: M2 #2030 (grounded reply from exact memory) and M3 #2031 (durable memory). Before
any work, open #2030, read its acceptance and its newest OWNER DIRECTION comment, and post a status
card on #2030: "M2 headline: X/512 complete correct replies (target 256) · line · count n/3 · next".

The standing direction (D21): the protected / discrete-constructor line is closed (#2079 … #2132).
Archive it as negative (patch + INDEX row where source is not activated), and start no further
constructor, attribution or solver step. Your next M2 piece must aim directly at the 8/512 number,
for example ordinary gradient training of reply completion on the saved native learner, scored on
the frozen 512 panel. Pre-register the bar, a stop rule and the cost on #2030, run it, and merge one
result PR.

Rules for this session: every PR states "Line · count n/3 · headline before → after"; at 3/3 post a
pivot card; at most two preparation PRs per session, each naming the run it prepares; a status card
on #2030 every 90 minutes or 3 merged PRs; end the session with a result, a pivot card or a blocked
card. Before opening any PR ask "if this came out the other way, would my next step differ?" — if
not, do not open it. When M2 is blocked on the owner, work on M3 (#2031) under the same rules.
```

## Changing this page

- The **contract** changes only by owner decision.
- The **standing direction** paragraph inside each prompt is updated when the milestone issue gets a new `OWNER DIRECTION` comment, so the prompt never points at a finished task.
