# Product-key memory trained into the M1 stack at the anchor's own steps: 19/40 on both seeds against the brief's 27/40 — the device fix works, the configuration does not

## The tooling fix this cycle landed (preparation PR)
| | |
|---|---|
| what | `ProductKeyMemory::cuda_fwd` = `cuda_ops::via_host3`, i.e. the op's exact CPU forward on `to_cpu_storage()` copies of the three inputs, uploaded back — the bridge the stack's other kernel-less configurations already use. The backward was already device-generic. **The CPU path is untouched**, so every existing artifact keeps its exact numbers. |
| where | [#2175](https://github.com/UOR-Foundation/uor-r4/pull/2175), branch `deepseek/memory-cuda-20261010` |
| checks | CPU build clean; `cargo test -p uor-r4-training --lib stack_memory` **7 passed** including the finite-difference gradient check; the **CUDA-enabled pod build compiles and passes parity** (the check a CPU-only local build cannot perform) |
| measured effect | **7.4 s/step → 0.19 s/step** (2,000 steps: ~2.5 h on CPU → **387 s on the GPU**, per arm, both arms in parallel) |

## The pre-registered run (D22 cycle 2)
| | |
|---|---|
| base | `chat-29m-B-lr5e-4` (`d8a3c971…`) — the memory is inside the fine-tune, from step 0, installed before the optimizer |
| memory | `memory_layers=4` of the 10-layer `rrarrarrar` stack (width 576), `memory_sub_keys=64`, `memory_top_k=16`, `memory_heads=4`, `memory_key_dim=64`, `memory_score=dot`, no codebook |
| data | the adopted base's own store, cycle 1's `mix-10` (`tokens.u16` `888241261c378138…`), unchanged |
| recipe | `steps=2000 batch=16 lr=2e-4 warmup=100 protocol=2 context=384 policy=full_prefix`, `pointer=32`, `pointer_gate_supervision=0`, `device=cuda` — **D10's own recipe**, so the contrast is the memory operator |
| seeds | `20261010` (**G1**, model `b1aa24e1…`, dev 0.3946, 377 s) and `20261011` (**G2**, model `25cf22c7…`, dev 0.3865, 379 s) |
| fitness | [`TEST FITNESS: FIT`](https://github.com/UOR-Foundation/uor-r4/issues/2029#issuecomment-6101635064) with two declared deviations (the frozen panel has 64 rows, not the brief's 80; the tagger/read split belongs to the exact-key arm this run does not test) |

## Results

### Frozen v5 memory panel (40 rows, frozen checks, cap 64)
| arm | steps | device | memory `check_pass` | unknowable | **wrong-value** | derangement |
|---|---:|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| D10 (adopted base, **no memory**) | 2,000 | GPU | **20/40** | 0/24 | 17 | 0 |
| **G1** (memory, seed 20261010) | 2,000 | GPU | **19/40** | 0/24 | 17 | 1 |
| **G2** (memory, seed 20261011) | 2,000 | GPU | **19/40** | 0/24 | 15 | 2 |
| *cpuM1 (memory, seed 20261010, **half the steps**)* | 1,000 | CPU | *22/40* | *2/24* | ***11*** | *2* |

**Bar (pre-registered): memory ≥ 27/40 on both seeds and BPB within 0.01 of the anchor. NOT MET on both
halves** — the seeds sit at 19/40 (one row under the adopted base, eight under the brief's bar) and G1's BPB is
**+0.0276** against the anchor, outside the 0.01 the bar allows. **No headline movement.**

### The development reading that names the next step
The same memory configuration fitted at **1,000 steps on the CPU** reads **22/40** — *above* the adopted base's
20/40 — with **11 wrong-value failures**, the best on this line (read binding's best was 12, the token-identity
pointer's 12). It is **not a claim**: it differs from the GPU arms in step count *and* device (GPU and CPU
reductions order differently, so the arms are not expected to be bit-identical), and its own cycle's
pre-registered bar was 24/40. It is exactly the kind of reading that needs a step-matched control before it can
mean anything.

### Float likelihood on the chat held-out stream
| arm | reading |
|---|---|
| D10 (anchor) | **1.17425 BPB** (nll 2.30985 over 6,169,728 targets, the whole held-out stream at context 384) |
| **G1** | **1.20184 BPB** — **+0.0276** against the anchor, i.e. outside the bar's 0.01 |
| G2 | pending |
| cpuM1 | pending |

### Open reply panel (232 rows, `fluent_and_relevant`), primary arm — **pending**
G1's replies are generating and its grading is in the shared judge queue as this record is written; posted
on #2029 when it lands. It cannot change the verdict, which the memory half decides (19/40 against 27/40).

## Decision

**REJECT for this configuration; the mechanism stays open (D22 §1).** The pre-registered bar for the
product-key-memory configuration — **≥ 27/40 on both seeds with BPB within 0.01** — is not met: 19/40, 19/40.
That closes *this configuration* (layer 4, 64 sub-keys, 16 top-k, replacing that layer's MLP, fitted from the
chat base for 2,000 steps) and nothing else.

**What it does establish, and what it does not.** The device fix works and is measured (0.19 s/step, 387 s per
2,000-step arm, both arms in parallel, the op's values unchanged — the CUDA forward *is* the CPU forward). The
configuration is *not* a winner at the anchor's step count on this panel. Neither statement is evidence about
the exact-key (prime/semiprime addressed store) arm of the same brief, which this run did not test.

**Next cycle, named now (cheapest first):**
1. **The step-matched control**: the identical recipe with **no memory** at 1,000 steps, two seeds — it decides
   whether cpuM1's 22/40 and wrong-value 11 come from the memory or from the shorter fit. Cheap now: ~6.5 min
   per pair on the GPU.
2. **Configuration variation at the anchor's steps**: the memory at a **read** layer (`a` in `rrarrarrar`) and
   with a larger sub-key set, one seed each, against the same frozen panel and bar.
3. **The exact-key arm** of the brief (prime/semiprime addressed store) — a different mechanism path from the
   native learner, and the one whose "tagger accuracy reported separately from read accuracy" item this run
   declared not applicable.

## Limitations

- **Two seeds, one configuration**; the panel's memory half is 40 rows and its noise is ±3 rows, which is why
  the bar was set at 27/40 rather than at a one-row difference.
- **The brief's ≥ 80-row panel cannot be met on v5** (64 rows: 40 memory + 24 unknowable) — declared as a
  deviation before compute and an owner question, not a lab decision.
- **CPU and GPU arms are not bit-identical** (different reduction orders), so the 1,000-step CPU reading is a
  development observation, not a controlled comparison; the control in (1) is what makes it one.
- **The BPB instrument differs from cycle 5's** (the D11 export path refuses a memory model; this uses
  `evaluate` with the same 2.837427 B/token lens), so the bar's "within 0.01" is read within this instrument.

## Cost

| | |
|---|---|
| pod | `l8uv41elowab34`, 2 × RTX 5090, leased 16:22Z, renewed to 22:35Z; the GPU fits used **12.8 minutes** of it (two arms in parallel, 387 s + 389 s wall) |
| GPU work | two 2,000-step fits; the CPU fits that preceded them (~2.2 h of the pod's CPU for one completed arm, superseded and stopped as declared) |
| laptop CPU | v5 replies and grading for three arms, the reply panel, analysis |
| external | none beyond the pod; inside the ≤ 4 pods / ≤ $8/h caps |

## Cycle 9: the step-matched control, and what the half-steps reading really was

The half-steps reading above (memory at 1,000 steps on CPU: 22/40, wrong-value 11) had two candidate
explanations — the memory, or the shorter fit. The control is the identical recipe with **no memory** at
**1,000 steps**, `device=cuda`, and it settles it:

| arm | memory | steps | device | v5 memory `check_pass` | unknowable | **wrong-value** | derangement |
|---|---|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| **C1 / C2 (control, no memory)** | — | 1,000 | GPU | **22/40** | 3/24 | **12** | 0 |
| cpuM1 (memory) | yes | 1,000 | CPU | 22/40 | 2/24 | 11 | 2 |
| G1 / G2 (memory) | yes | 2,000 | GPU | 19/40 | 0/24 | 17 / 15 | 1 / 2 |
| D10 (adopted base, no memory) | — | 2,000 | GPU | 20/40 | 0/24 | 17 | 0 |

**The 22/40 was the shorter fit.** The matched control reads the same two rows and one wrong-value row away,
so the memory configuration contributes **nothing measurable on this panel at either step count** — and at the
anchor's steps it reads one row *below* the no-memory anchor while costing **+0.026 BPB** on the chat held-out
stream. The mechanism is untouched by that (D22 §1: a configuration, not a mechanism); the *configuration* is
what is rejected.

**A measured note on the control's two seeds.** C1 and C2 are **bit-identical** (`model.sha256`
`90c382d6…`, dev 0.4274, 63 s wall each): without a memory to draw, `seed=` has nothing to initialise, since
every weight comes from the checkpoint and the data order is fixed by `data_seed`. The memory arms' seed
variation therefore comes entirely from the added memory — the property [#2170](https://github.com/UOR-Foundation/uor-r4/pull/2170)
restored — and the control is one run reported twice.

**Cost of the memory's host bridge, measured:** 1,000 steps took **63 s** without the memory and **~190 s**
with it (the CUDA arms), i.e. **≈ 0.13 s/step** of transfer and host compute for the op — real, small next to
the trunk, and the reason the *kernel* remains the honest follow-up rather than a claim that the bridge is
free.

**What the next cycle does, decided by this reading:** the memory's *placement and size* at the anchor's steps
(a **read** layer `a` of `rrarrarrar`, and a larger sub-key set), one seed each against the same frozen panel
and bar; then the brief's **exact-key arm** (prime/semiprime addressed store) with the tagger-versus-read split
the brief asks for.
