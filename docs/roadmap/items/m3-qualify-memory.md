## Why it matters

M3 is the claim that a conversation can be stored and come back exactly, with answers staying grounded in what was said (issue #2031). The memory pieces exist but have only been tested on fixtures, so no result yet says that a trained model uses its memory. This item turns them into one measured verdict on the selected native model, and `m4-export-uorlut01-cli` depends on it. Background: [exact memory](../../mechanisms/exact-memory.md).

## What is missing

m3-memory is not qualified on the selected model. The object-store consumer and frozen 384-item host-control panel are built and pass, but the on-model M3 run still needs an M1-or-M2 model selection; M1's completion alone is not M3 qualification ([consumer record](../../labs/object-store-consumer-m3/README.md)). The evaluator and session exist (`stack_grounded_session`, the typed-script multi-turn evaluator, `IntegerStackSession`, and the `UR4SESS1` session file). `crates/uor-r4-training/src/stack_grounded_session.rs` describes itself (line 6) as "a float development path, not a D11 serving kernel": the integer-path verdict must come from `IntegerStackSession`, not from that module alone.

M1 is complete, and M2 is in progress under D67 rather than a blanket owner hold. The older 437/512 then 0/128 result remains a panel-fitting lesson, not the current saved-model result. The M3 bar is "Memory persists across sessions and answers stay grounded". The six per-sub-panel thresholds are registered in the consumer record; the on-model qualification has not run.

## Done when

On the selected artifact:

- Provenance, contradiction and correction, abstention on unstated or retracted facts, explicit reset and process restart all pass.
- Saved and restored sessions continue identically token for token (`IntegerStackSession` plus `UR4SESS1`).

**Original acceptance text at item start, when the thresholds were not yet registered:** the pass threshold for each check was not yet registered.

That original text is preserved rather than rewritten in this PR. The current six per-sub-panel thresholds are recorded in the [consumer record](../../labs/object-store-consumer-m3/README.md); the on-model run has not happened.

## How to start

1. **Read the code and run the host tests.** Open `crates/uor-r4-integer/src/session_codec.rs` (`UR4SESS1` `encode` and `decode`), `crates/uor-r4-integer/src/stack/session.rs` (`IntegerStackSession`), `crates/uor-r4-training/src/stack_grounded_session.rs` and `crates/uor-r4-training/src/grounded_session_eval.rs`. Run `~/.cargo/bin/cargo test -p uor-r4-integer --features serving-wasm`; without that feature the serving modules (`session_codec`, `stack`) are not compiled, and the last recorded run was 165 passed (`docs/labs/wasm-serving-runtime-2026-10-18/README.md:30`). Confirm which file holds the typed-script multi-turn evaluator; `grounded_session_eval.rs` (frozen-script diagnostics, schema `uor-r4.grounded-script/1`) is the likely one.
2. **First deliverable: a coverage note on the issue.** List each of the six behaviours (provenance, contradiction and correction, abstention, reset, process restart, token-for-token restore) against the evaluator case that tests it, or mark it missing. State whether `m3-memory-turn-discriminator-gate` and `m3-policy-precedence-and-sieve-tests` change the evaluator. Confirm the evaluator scores with exact typed-script graders and no softmax, squashing or matrix multiply.
3. **Draft the pre-registration sheet.** Select an M1 or M2 artifact and name it by hash; M1's completion alone does not qualify M3. Freeze the typed-script panel as files, list each with its SHA-256, and keep it separate from any development scripts. Register the per-check thresholds, seeds, GPU, stop rule and cost. Ask a non-author for a TEST FITNESS: FIT review.
4. **Write the finite restore control first, as a failing test.** In `crates/uor-r4-integer/tests/`, build a synthetic stack (see `crates/uor-r4-integer/src/bin/mk-synthetic-stack.rs`, a binary that needs `--features serving-wasm`; run the new test with the same feature), run a few turns, save with `UR4SESS1`, restore in a fresh process, and require the continued token stream to equal an uninterrupted run.
5. **Select the model and run the pre-run review.** Select the M1 or M2 candidate; the on-model M3 run then follows its registered FIT and the lab's D67 pre-run review, with no blanket owner hold. Outside contributors attach hardware specs to the PR.
6. **Open a PR** that says `Closes #<this issue>` (or `References` if partial), and record the verdict as one row in `docs/research/notebook/m3-durable-memory.md`.

## Rules that apply

- **Geometry only** (CHARTER §3.1–§3.3): every mechanism, training signal and fix comes from the project's geometry. No softmax or squashing anywhere, including losses, gradients, sampling and renamed or table forms. No dense matrix multiplication or GEMM, including wrappers and hand loops.
- **GPU only** (§3.5): training, evaluation and qualification run on a GPU, never a CPU. Outside contributors may run on their own GPU and must attach the hardware specs to the PR. If the hardware is not equivalent to the project baseline (an RTX 5090), a maintainer re-runs it after the PR, under the same FIT (owner, 20 Oct 2026).
- **Pre-registration first** (§4.5): a GPU training or evaluation run, and any run a milestone claim rests on, needs a one-page sheet with a non-author TEST FITNESS: FIT review before it runs.
- **Rust first** (§3.11): new code is Rust, and no new Python is added.
- **Records** (§4.1, §5.6): each result is one row in its line's research notebook (`docs/research/notebook/<line>.md`). A negative result closes a configuration, never a mechanism.
