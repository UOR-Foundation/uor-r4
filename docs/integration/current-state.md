## Active: shared learned transitions and complete result continuation executed

**Executed the shared-transition brief** on merged `86623138` (PR #1338). New `--mode=shared-transition` and module `learner/shared_transition.rs`: `s0 = E[selected payload]`, `s_j = A[observed primitive j] * s_{j-1}`, `out_j = D(s_j)`, and a learned remaining-indexed `Stop`. One action per primitive is **reused at every occurrence**, the state is retained between emitted tokens (emitted tokens are never re-read as a query), and `Emit`/`Stop`/`UnknownValue`/`UnknownPrimitive`/`NoGrounding` are distinct typed outcomes. Artifact `RLST` v1, exported and independently reloaded with full-trajectory parity before any reported response.

**Result.** On an authored ordered-primitive fixture with a witnessed non-abelian order-8 action subgroup, the primary completes **48/128 unseen length-4 ordered combinations** against **0** for an exact transition dictionary and 24 for the best matched control; development is 186/288 complete and 556/672 tokens, all 288 development responses stop, and the learned stop policy transfers to the unseen length 4. Four complete responses were generated from held-out prompts and three are exactly correct. A recount from the 1,312 saved per-step events equals the arm totals (244 = 186 + 48 + 10).

**Causal controls.** A payload change at an identical query and identical primitives changes every step to the expected label; the state trajectory is independent of emitted tokens; a **noncommuting witness** on the learned codes shows H4's final result state differs under a single reversal (72 vs 90) while the additive arm's final token is provably invariant (4090 both ways); unknown primitive and undefined value are typed rather than identity; absent source yields no response; lengths 1-4 all stop.

**Withdrawn and corrected:** the earlier claim that missing fixture cells are independent free parameters (the rectangle identity and connected graph refute it); the earlier development probe was supervised outer fitting through an initialized-domain defect, not held-out-operation generalization; the earlier operation/identity/absence controls were defective and are replaced.

**Next:** persistent source ownership and a separate observed control channel to remove the instruction/selection coupling, then a dependent second read whose query and answer change with the first selected evidence; and a fitting method that converges on the action structure (development is 186/288). [Result](shared-transition-result-2026-09-21.md); [evidence](../evidence/shared-transition-2026-09-21.json). Retained roots `shared-transition-{1,4,5,6}` (0 unlisted).

## Former active: shared learned transitions and owned response continuation

**PR #1338, independently reviewed:** retain the reported value-only lexical decoder result, 161/180 development, 108/120 tune and 104/120 final, matching its same-run dictionary. The prior residual 33/120 uses different seeds, and the original winning decoder was not exported/served. Composition H4's 8/64 is independently reconstructed, but two supervised probe operations were absent from the learned vocabulary and fell back to identity. **Missing cells are not independent free parameters of a shared product family.** The original intervention/identity/parity claims are narrowed in the [principal review](derived-state-decoder-review-2026-09-21.md) and [audit](../evidence/derived-state-decoder-principal-review-2026-09-21.json).

**Next:** [shared learned transitions with owned result and response continuation](deepseek-shared-transition-continuation-step-2026-09-21.md). Retain the decoder, learn/reuse primitive actions from observed sequences, and carry the computed result through Read/Compute/Emit/Stop or a dependent read. Separate exact evidence, reversible geometric transport and noninvertible control; preserve a valid identity as distinct from absence/unknown/missing lexicalization. Principal source repairs the supervised domains, winner export/load and controls; the [executed checks/replay receipt](../evidence/derived-state-decoder-principal-checks-2026-09-21.json) owns actual corrected results. Exposed replay is not fresh qualification. Structural role/scope, relative H4/Spin/Hopf and finite spectral features remain tools for concrete needs; paired-H4/E8/S7 remains conditional.

**Corrected exposed replay:** the exported, independently loaded value-only winner retains 161/180 development, 108/120 tune and 104/120 final emitted answers. Composition remains negative: H4 92/192 development and 3/64 held-out positions; C120 106/192 and 4/64. H4 lacks a grounded decoder outcome at 60/64 held-out positions despite 64 actual reads. Three association rollouts begin correctly but lose meaningful continuation. The fixed-selected-operand operation pair works; the end-to-end operation change loses its read. This directs the successor toward learned transition/outcome consistency, independent source ownership and persistent response phase. These are exposed regression results, not new final qualification.

**Research leadership and autonomy:** Codex owns holistic architecture, mathematical/evidence interpretation and roadmap revision. DeepSeek has substantive implementation/diagnostic judgment, complete lifecycle responsibility and standing-authorized necessary local extensions with prospective accounting. No arbitrary short timer or retry quota replaces scientific judgment, preservation or physical limits.

Four completed original roots 1/2/4/5 have six valid listed files each; root 3 is partial/unsealed with an association artifact. Original two new source hashes do not match the submitted head, so exact source equality is not claimed. Preserve the old result with its audit and use the separately identified principal replay for repaired behavior. General prose, reasoning, whole-path D0-b and energy advantage remain unqualified.

## Historical PR #1338 submission (corrected above): a useful learned result decoder, and composition limited by free operand codes

**Executed the derived-state brief.** New `--mode=derived-state-decoder` decodes the frame-free relative result `s = T_bind[r] * U_op[observed query role] * V[value]` through a bounded learned per-state token shortlist (<= 16 grounded states, k = 4), with a computed identity emittable and **distinct from `NoRead`**. Old zero-residual artifacts and their contracts are untouched; this is a new `RLDS`/`RLRD` interface.

**Useful association result.** On new populations the value-only derived-state decoder reproduces the strongest selected-value dictionary exactly (dev 161/180, tune 108/120, **final 104/120**) with 8 grounded states, against the retained residual readout's 61/41/33. The full-factor decoder fits development better (166) and generalizes worse (91 final), so the binding/operation factors are nuisance on this task. Readout is now a learned lexical emission over computed state.

**Composition, honestly bounded.** Fixture v2 (modulus 10, witnessed order-10 element, 8 observed-query operations, 192 development / 64 held-out cells) with a development-internal probe over held-out *operations*. Probe hits rise from 0/48 to 27/48 (H4) and held-out cells from 0/64 to 8/64 when probe hits lead the objective; the declared screen is **not met**, and matched additive C120 is stronger (20/64) because the declared rule is additive in `(op, vi)`. The residual obstacle is measured: held-out `(operation, value)` combinations are **free parameters** for a per-operation/per-value code family, not an H4 capacity limit. The earlier "no linear readout can solve it" framing is withdrawn as over-claimed.

**Interventions hold structurally:** changing the observed operation or the relevant payload changes the emitted token; an irrelevant distractor is ignored; removing the required source, disabling read or disabling update all return `NoRead` with the local prior; a composed identity is an Emit, not `NoRead`.

**Next:** either a composition task whose combination rule is forced by the observed inputs, or a **structured one-parameter code family** instead of eight free operand codes, before retrying multi-operation composition; then dependent Read/Emit/Stop once one read is useful. [Result](derived-state-decoder-result-2026-09-21.md); [evidence](../evidence/derived-state-decoder-2026-09-21.json). Retained roots `derived-state-decoder-{1,4,5}` (0 unlisted).

## Former active: learned derived-state decoding and valid composition transfer

**PR #1337, independently reviewed:** the corrected learner now executes output → maps → output and improves H4 to **33/120 exposed-final answers and 7/60 complete pairs**, from 25/120 and 1/60. The learned selected-value lookup remains 108/120 and 54/60. Four report seals and artifact hashes verify; short association generation remains degenerate. **Zero observed feature aliases does not prove linear impossibility.** The composition negative used modulo 7 with an order-10 witness and withheld whole operand meanings; it does not test combinations of familiar primitives. [Principal review](geometric-computation-review-2026-09-21.md); [independent audit](../evidence/geometric-computation-principal-review-2026-09-21.json).

**Next:** [learn to decode the actual geometric result and test familiar-component composition](deepseek-derived-state-decoder-step-2026-09-21.md). Use an artifact-bound learned result decoder with explicit validity: a computed identity is a legitimate result, distinct from NoRead. When necessary, separate learned observed-query operation from source-compatibility relation. The principal runner repairs the composition witness/split and retains actual per-arm predictions for recounting; no new fit on the repaired task is claimed. Establish useful read → computation → emission, then dependent Read/Emit/Stop; structural scope/retention, relative Hopf/H4 and finite spectral features remain tools for concrete needs, with paired-H4/E8/S7 conditional. A cyclic-task tie with C120 can establish competence, not unique H4 advantage.

**Research leadership and autonomy:** Codex owns holistic architecture, mathematical/evidence interpretation and roadmap revision after every returned run. DeepSeek owns substantive implementation/diagnostic decisions within that direction and may pursue justified follow-ons and standing-authorized local allowance extensions with prospective accounting. No arbitrary short timer or retry quota replaces scientific judgment, preservation or physical machine limits.

[Executed principal checks](../evidence/geometric-computation-principal-checks-2026-09-21.json) validate instrument/source repairs, not a new model fit. The original association and composition roots remain sealed. The [ledger](resource-ledger-2026-09-19.md) reconciles the prior component debit and records principal costs/storage. Whole-path D0-b, general language and energy advantage remain unqualified.

## Historical PR #1337 submission (diagnoses corrected above): readout-limited association and the measured relation-interface obstruction

**Executed the corrected lifecycle for the first time** (PR #1336 source at `036e9c43`). The repaired learner runs end to end; every stage improves one committed served objective (H4 19.86 -> 7.87 bits, C120 19.86 -> 8.29), the post-map refit executes and is consumed, 64 serving rows and reload parity hold. On the exposed regression populations the deployed predictor improves to H4 61/180 dev, 41/120 tune, 33/120 final and 7/60 pairs (pre-repair 50/36/25 and 1/60). The declared screen still fails against the 108/120 selected-value table; the seeds are exposed and no fresh evaluation is claimed.

**New measured diagnosis.** On source-correct positions the **actual served feature does not alias**: dev 163 positions into 50 distinct `R(q1)-R(q0)` features with **zero** conflicting targets, final 108 into 46 with zero. The table-on-feature ceiling is 100 %, while the deployed **linear** ternary residual reaches 61/180 and 33/120. The association gap is a **readout-family** limitation, not feature aliasing or value-code injectivity; a smaller reader/input ambiguity covers 8 signatures / 21 dev positions.

**Relation composition.** New `--mode=relation-composition` instrument (answer derived from the query operation composed with retrieved content, held-out value cells, fair two-input control). Measured obstruction: the served **relation interface exposes only two distinct relative elements across fourteen role pairs**, so an eight-operation composition is not representable through `T[rel]`. At the reduced two-operation budget H4 scores 15/48 dev and **0/16 held-out**, with no held-out state reached in development. Negative retained.

**Next:** attach a **learned lexical decoder** to the actual selected/derived state (brief option B) -- the required feature-to-target function is not linear in the current 16 ternary features -- and expose a richer relation/operation signal in the update (brief option C) before retrying multi-operation composition. [Result](geometric-computation-result-2026-09-21.md); [evidence](../evidence/geometric-computation-2026-09-21.json).

## Former active: coherent geometric computation and learned lexical emission

**PR #1336, independently reviewed:** retain the repaired units, loaded-artifact execution and injective value codes, plus H4's reported 25/120 final answers (1/60 complete pairs). The learned selected-value lookup scores 108/120 and 54/60 pairs, exactly matching correct selected payloads. This is familiar-association performance in new contexts, not compositional transfer. Training still used 4,096 output rows before a 64-row serving projection; the required output refit after changed maps was omitted. The result does not isolate geometric expressivity. Both seven-file seals verify; short generation ran and remains degenerate. [Principal review](consistent-emission-review-2026-09-21.md); [audit](../evidence/consistent-emission-principal-review-2026-09-21.json).

**Next:** [complete a useful geometric Read → Transform → Emit path](deepseek-geometric-computation-step-2026-09-21.md). Principal source repairs share hard sparse projection/CE, retain incumbents and wire output → maps → output into the actual learner. Execute the corrected lifecycle, retain the association regression, and choose the best justified emitter or learned lexical-decoder donor. Then advance genuine query-and-content-dependent composition and learned dependent reads. Geometric superiority on arbitrary lexical association is not an entry requirement. Structural scope/retention, relative Hopf/H4 and finite spectral features are available where they preserve a needed distinction; general S7 fields remain conditional. No new full fit or language qualification is claimed by the principal repairs.

**Research leadership and autonomy:** Codex owns holistic architecture, evidence interpretation and roadmap revision after every returned run; DeepSeek owns substantive implementation/diagnostic decisions within that direction. It may pursue justified follow-ons and standing-authorized local allowance extensions with prospective accounting.

Original roots `consistent-emission-{1,2}` remain sealed and preserved; one final seed draw plus a report-only replay.

## Former active: consistent contextual emission before expansion

**PR #1335, independently reviewed:** the new older-payload pairs support a **reported noncopy signal**, H4 35/180 development and 13/120 exposed regression, with only 1/60 regression pairs both correct. Retain that signal; withdraw the readout-capacity-only diagnosis. The submitted coordinate optimizer loses accepted incumbents, raw-score loss omits fixed-point scaling, and fit/serve residual shifts differ. Any-read counts are not source correctness; final data were exposed before selection; the learned value map aliases required distinctions and loaded-artifact behavior is unqualified. [Principal review](contextual-emission-review-2026-09-21.md); [audit](../evidence/contextual-emission-principal-review-2026-09-21.json).

**Next:** [one consistent hard-forward contextual-emission fit](deepseek-consistent-emission-step-2026-09-21.md) at the existing width/state count, using the corrected numerical/causal/export contract and an explicit output/maps/output learning stage. Inspect actual source correctness, feature aliases and margins before any expansion. A relative-transition readout is a conditional geometric alternative if an actual nuisance-frame or cycle obstruction is witnessed. Dependent reads follow a useful one-read primitive; structural persistence and S7/E8/Hopf/harmonic tools remain available for demonstrated needs. No new model fit or broader language qualification is claimed by the principal repair.

Original aggregate receipts remain in `contextual-emission-{1,2,3,4}`; old “fresh” means exposed regression. Source and evidence corrections supersede their diagnoses. The actual absolute ledger is authoritative; the missing prior charge is reconciled and the principal check debit is separate.

## Former active: learn contextual transformation and shared emission at the correct boundary

**PR #1334, independently reviewed and corrected:** short frozen-confidence generation is verified: H4 23/42 reads, categorical 22/42, valid exact references and disabled/local token parity 7/7. The new update result is a **seeded frozen-row diagnostic with an invalid contextual instrument**: target depends on the query suffix, extraction omits its last key, accuracy-only search makes no parameter changes, and the alleged categorical arm is the same H4 algebra. The reported 0/60 ceiling is limited to those extracted positions, not a sole-readout diagnosis. Original confidence preservation failures remain exposed replays. [Principal review](read-conditioned-review-2026-09-21.md); [audit](../evidence/read-conditioned-principal-review-2026-09-21.json).

**Next:** [one genuinely context-required transformation with a learned shared low-bit emitter](deepseek-contextual-emission-step-2026-09-21.md). Use identical-query pairs with changed older payloads and different uncopied outputs, correct full-prefix serving, useful NLL/margin learning, a real matched alternate update algebra and actual changed-source/disabled generation. Retain admission/selection and exact ownership initially; dependent scheduling follows a useful one-read primitive. Structural/Hopf and conditional S7/E8/harmonic tools remain available for witnessed needs. No new trained model or broader language qualification is claimed by the principal repair.

All 12 sealed files, five RLR2/four parent hashes and three declared source hashes verify. The new module was omitted from the original source binding. Both RLRC maps match initialization; reported answer-NLL reductions are not learned gains. Original new oracle/accuracy aggregates lack sufficient per-position rows for independent replay without inference; only four update trajectories remain. Six-token confidence continuations do not qualify conflict/source interventions or useful complete responses. Principal code repairs full-prefix extraction, first-token/equal-horizon scoring, loader use/bounds and future source inventory; focused checks do not rerun model evaluation.

### Historical submission and earlier states (read with the active corrections)

## Historical submission: read-conditioned rollout and originally claimed readout diagnosis

**Frozen-confidence rollout executed.** The actual retained confidence artifacts now run through the shared target-free predictor: length-64 opcode dispatch after reload, 45 reads over 84 steps with exact selected occurrences and served actions, read-disabled reproducing local, degenerate text consistent with the retained whole-model negative. [Result](read-conditioned-result-2026-09-21.md); [evidence](../evidence/read-conditioned-2026-09-21.json).

**Corrected confidence criteria preserved (own parents, CE included).** Fresh population: H4 confidence 71/117 present emitted (own parent 73), present CE **+0.159790 bits/query**, absent reads **11/10**, text +0.037882, tune +0.061316; categorical 79/117 (own parent 81), **+0.152981**, **7/6**, +0.020116, +0.061381; whole-stream 178 (parent 364) and 184 (parent 378). Both meet the emitted-count margin and the fresh text screen and **both fail own-parent present CE and absence**. Retain the fitted expressivity gain; no promotion.

**One learned read-conditioned geometric update — bounded negative at a diagnosed ceiling.** `q1 = (q0*T[r])*V[payload]`, `z1 = z_local + u(q1) - u(q0)`, `NoRead`/`UpdateDisabled` exactly zero. Instrument (derived role-partner; answer absent from every admitted payload; 60/60 local-wrong; 0 coverage violations): the **oracle ceiling is 0/60** — no frozen readout row can emit the required uncopied answer — so accuracy is 0.000 on dev/tune/fresh for H4 and the matched categorical arm. The update is causally live (28/30 fresh positions change state; changing the relation changes the emitted token at 9; answer CE falls ~0.25–0.30 bits) but cannot reach the answer.

**Next:** the limitation is the **shared emission readout**, not admission, selection or update expressivity. Add one **learned small shared low-bit output residual** so a read-conditioned state can place mass on a token absent from the prefix; keep the transport/value maps, the exact-zero disabled path and the artifacts. Dependent Read -> Update -> Read/Emit follows only after a useful causal transformation. Whole-model prose remains degenerate; energy UNAVAILABLE; whole-path D0-b not claimed.

## Former active: retain confidence access; learn a read-conditioned geometric emission update

**PR #1333, independently reviewed and corrected:** the confidence sign restores fitted policy expressivity; both selected tables meet development-fit constraints. Fresh joint preservation fails for both: H4 present 71/117 versus parent 73, categorical 79 versus its own parent 81; present CE worsens **+0.159790/+0.152981 bits/query** above +.05, and absent reads rise **11/10 and 7/6**. Text deltas remain **+0.037882/+0.020116 bits/token**; both tune text screens fail. Confidence generation/intervention/timing are NOT_RUN. Preserve this useful interface component without promotion. [Principal review](reader-confidence-review-2026-09-21.md); [audit](../evidence/reader-confidence-principal-review-2026-09-21.json).

**Next:** [one learned read-conditioned geometric update feeding shared emission](deepseek-read-conditioned-state-step-2026-09-21.md), beginning with compact frozen-confidence rollout. A payload-only logit boost cannot change relative odds between two uncopied tokens; 939/976 fresh text targets are absent from admitted payloads. Learn one bounded signed-H4 transport/shared residual and test a noncopy output with actual changed-source/NoRead/update-disabled controls and a matched ordinary-state comparator. End automatic scalar-copy feature expansion; an extra text/query bit is not established as the missing mechanism. Keep source admission/ranking and exact identities fixed initially; dependent reads and learned stopping follow a useful one-read transformation. No new model result is claimed by this review.

Both tables satisfy fit constraints; their claimed exhaustive optima remain scoped to operational support/fallback, with missing 64x4 coefficients preventing independent optimizer reconstruction. On whole fresh construction, H4 emissions 178 versus 364 parent and categorical 184 versus 378 accompany loss increases +.837488/+.833452 bits/position. The final-query count tolerance does not qualify broad preservation. Both tune text deltas exceed +.05. Three valid ten-file seals, five artifact/four parent hashes and all three submitted source hashes verify; attempts 2/3 repeat attempt 1's first exposure. All 36 old Dev documents are now reader-exposed. Confidence rollout, interventions, timing and loaded-logit witness parity remain next-run work; old coarse panels cannot qualify them.

The current copy operator changes only a payload logit. A nonnegative boost cannot improve loss where the correct token is absent from every admitted payload, or change the relative odds of two nonpayload tokens. A learned finite update plus shared residual can express that operation, but its usefulness/geometry advantage remains unmeasured. Exact occurrence/version ownership, signed H4/Spin, retained Hopf fiber and conditional S7/E8/harmonics remain available; one root is not lossless prefix memory.

The live ledger has been reconciled with the prior run's full components and reported allowance extension; see the [latest ledger](resource-ledger-2026-09-19.md) for principal check debits. Only 32 inactive incremental-cache directories in an older worktree were removed, recovering 4.358 GB observed free space to 39.78 GB before checks. All unique source/research/models/reports/worktrees/downloads remain. Reserve 36766079385 bytes plus 128 MiB remains; refresh physical free space and charge all work prospectively.

## Former active: restore existing learned read confidence at the influence interface

**PR #1332, independently reviewed and corrected:** exact integer reconstruction confirms the unchanged 32-address influence class cannot preserve the development parent's answers and absence behavior. At absent reads <=7, H4 can emit at most **74** correct answers and categorical **71**, against **145** required, even with every bucket free. This is an information collision in the coarse five-bit influence observation, not an H4 capacity limit. Generic solver objective/tolerance and saturated-loss checks are repaired; the retained count certificate is independent of those optimizer defects. [Principal review](policy-obstruction-review-2026-09-21.md); [audit](../evidence/policy-obstruction-principal-review-2026-09-21.json).

**Next:** [restore the retained reader's learned Read–NoRead advantage](deepseek-reader-confidence-step-2026-09-21.md) at the influence interface. Artifact inspection establishes a parent-preserving construction: the same selected source, `D>0` -> eight nats, `D<=0`/empty pool -> NoRead. Verify actual causal-prefix parity first, then test one compact dose policy under joint text, present-answer and absence requirements. The existing five-bit observation plus this sign admits the parent within 64 entries. Parent text harm remains; useful influence and matched geometry advantage must be measured. No fresh final result or model promotion is claimed. End the unchanged-policy search; structural persistence, derived composition, generative language and efficiency remain the broader responsibilities.

The independent development certificate uses 197 present/23 absent queries, parent 149 correct/seven absent reads. Reaching 145 correct requires at least 16 H4/15 categorical absent reads. Both attempt seals, three exported artifacts and four parent hashes verify. Both attempts replay exposed panels; no fresh final. Exact executed-runner/source correspondence is unresolved, the fit digest omits some causal dependencies, and saved statistics omit per-position/tune arrays. Preserve the results with these limits; the next substantive run completes the relevant boundaries.

The confidence witness is artifact/source-derived, not a newly executed rollout. The same ordered candidate pool and parent bucket are required; Read/NoRead score ties abstain and source-score ties retain the first candidate. Matched categorical confidence fitting is required for geometry attribution. Signed H4/Spin, exact identity, retained Hopf fiber, structural lifetimes and shared typed operators remain reusable; S7/E8/harmonics are conditional tools, not replacements justified by this result.

Resources were reconciled from the stale live JSON, including the prior component estimate correction. Inactive incremental compiler cache cleanup recovered 4.32 GB of observed free space (5.159GB allocated files); no model/research/source/download deletion. See the latest measured checks and balance in the [ledger](resource-ledger-2026-09-19.md), and refresh before execution. The 36.766 GB reserve plus 128 MiB margin remains; bookkeeping extensions do not create disk space.

Freeze current source learners and observations, compare matched categorical capacity, and evaluate one selected candidate on fresh data. Infeasible or unresolved solves and failed fresh evaluation end this scalar-policy campaign. Any missing-observation/operator diagnosis requires evidence; timeout alone is a computational limitation.

Corrected H4's fitted table has 16 supported buckets; 13 are unobserved and three below support. Mixed objective improvement does not establish that all current-feature policies must fail, and existing source confidence may be discarded by the coarse observation. Same-seed previous admission values reproduce 0.200636/0.831657 nats; different-seed values 0.194595/0.831637 are not rounding. Present correct payload selection is 98/121 for both parent and policy, despite the emitted regression. Six all-present generated probes give 3/6 versus parent 4/6 first answers; no absent generation is retained. General prose remains degenerate.

**PR #1328, independently reviewed:** the exported policy retains a small reader-held-out text probability gain: H4 **−0.019477 bits/token [−0.032861,−0.005507]**, eight documents /1,952 positions; all five declared document intervals reproduce. Text emitted correctness remains 406/1,952, equal to local; general prose remains degenerate. Full construction emitted correctness drops 362→29. **The contextual-representation diagnosis is withdrawn:** fitting used legacy zero gap thresholds and serving used new negative thresholds, leaving 24/32 gap-band entries untrained.

Preserve the measured artifact gain; `absence_improved` and complete loader binding are unqualified, incremental cost unresolved, and the recorded runner SHA does not match merged source.

The merged threshold-ordering defect is strongly corroborated by saved fit support only in gap band zero.

The H4 policy reads all candidate-bearing positions; on the fixture's 22 absent final queries that implies 22 reads from the retained policy/fixture contract, not a saved per-stratum counter. Its reduced absent loss does not establish improved abstention, and the parent absent read count was not saved. Preserve historical booleans with correction, not as qualified criteria. Candidate-only admission opportunities are 0.200636 construction/0.649680 text nats; full-stream values 0.831657/0.529129 include empty-pool cases. Target-using opportunity is not an achieved gain.

## Preserved baseline: the corrected replay of the frozen step-512 prior

The result below remains valid at its scope; its dated next-action and resource paragraphs are historical and are superseded by the active section above.

The replay's artifact/data integrity, all saved scorer means and full-panel intervals remain independently verified by the [principal review](ordered-prefix-review-2026-09-20.md). Its valid positive gates remain.

**The frozen step-512 artifact's evaluation is repaired and executed.** PR #1301 delivered the [principal review](frozen-prior-review-2026-09-20.md) and the [execution prompt](deepseek-frozen-prior-step-2026-09-20.md). This run loaded the retained `prior_realtext.cpl2` **unchanged**, repaired the two evaluation instruments, replayed the frozen artifact, recovered exposure, added count references, diagnosed greedy loops, and made two value-preserving primitive corrections with exact pre/post inference parity. The real-text artifact and original sealed result were unchanged; one named unit fixture did perform 60 toy optimizer updates.

**Reproduction first.** The corrected replay reconstructs the legacy population exactly — **429 Markdown documents / 7,609,837 bytes**, 355 fit / 38 tune / 36 dev-pool docs, 38,987 fit windows / 2,446,208 targets — and the 32-document × 3-opening-window legacy panel (96 windows / 6,048 targets). It reproduces the recorded unpermuted micro cross-entropy to ~1e-15 bits/target: contextual **7.142472**, frozen quantized bias **9.131630**, exact full-fit unigram **9.059915**. The reconstructed full-fit unigram also reproduces the artifact's frozen bias codes exactly.

**Corrected instruments.** The context permutation is a seeded Fisher–Yates bijection per `(document, PAD/non-PAD)` stratum over occurrence indices, so repeated contexts with different targets stay distinct observations and the target vector never moves. Aggregation sums every document's windows before any macro or bootstrap step.

| Quantity | Historical (withdrawn) | Corrected replay |
| --- | ---: | ---: |
| Constant-predictor permuted CE (step 0 control) | 9.1364 | **9.131630** (exactly invariant, max per-occurrence delta 0.0) |
| Permutation penalty, full panel | +2.8744 | **+3.0572** [2.8552, 3.2543] |
| Permutation penalty, eligible subset | — | **+3.0858** [2.8761, 3.2834] |
| Evaluated documents | 36 claimed | **32** (four discarded by global truncation) |
| Applied association count | 5,805 (undescribed) | 5,992 changed-context records of 6,048 (5,996 moved) |

**Decisions** use the frozen 0.10-bit threshold with paired document intervals excluding zero and all identity/control/support checks passing:

- **Legacy panel PASS** — unigram gain **+1.9174** [1.7744, 2.0641], bias gain **+1.9892** [1.8439, 2.1271].
- **Spread-position panel PASS** — all 36 dev-pool documents, first/last windows, 72 windows / 3,734 targets, unequal per-document counts (71–126): unigram gain **+1.7710** [1.6445, 1.9033], bias gain **+1.8363** [1.7011, 1.9712], eligible perm penalty **+2.9012** [2.7355, 3.0808]. The panel is additional open development evaluation, not fresh final held-out; 32 of its 36 documents also appear in the legacy panel with different windows.

Both intervals are nominal on correlated repository documents: screening evidence, not held-out qualification.

**Count references (tuned on 64 windows from 32 of the 38 tune-pool docs; λ₁=0.8, λ₂=0.7; 64 tune windows, 4.2255 bits/target).** On the same 6,048 targets the interpolated order-2 reference reaches **3.9691** bits/target from full-fit counts and **5.1965** from consumed-window counts, while the frozen two-token learned predictor stays at **7.1425**. The same-input gap shows unrecovered local predictive performance. It does not distinguish optimization dose, quantization, regularization or capacity, and does not itself demonstrate a need for older history. The consumed reference reuses the full-reference smoothing choice. On contexts unseen in the consumed fit the model scores 8.5730 against the consumed-count reference's 6.9030.

**Generation and loops.** The three recorded prefixes are confirmed to be one document. All six trajectories — three legacy prefixes plus three genuinely distinct spread-panel documents (short/medium/long) — enter a period-1 cycle within ≤11 steps. `argmax Z(32,32) = 32` is a fixed point confirmed from integer scores (top-1 4608, top-2 3584, margin 1,024, no ties) and is supported by local statistics (full-fit 1,947/6,099; consumed 246/725); the interpolated reference also selects 32, so that fixed-point choice is shared by the learned prior and the count references. At `(284,198)` the model selects 198 (margin 384) where the reference selects 80; the next pair `(198,198)` emits 504, so this is immediate repetition, not a self-loop. The pair-inspection flag omitted `prev == cur`; actual trace cycle detection is correct. Count-reference trajectories were not executed; one-step agreement does not diagnose the cause of complete generation collapse. The context-disabled control collapses to a fixed point even faster. No repetition penalty, token blacklist, output override or decoder change was added.

**Exposure recovered** from the final CPCK v3: step 512, cursor 4096, pass 0, permutation length 38,987 (all distinct). The consumed 4,096 windows sum to **257,113** `n−1` targets, against the 2,446,208 full-fit targets used to fit the frozen marginal. The four timing-probe updates remain a discarded trainer's work.

**Primitive corrections with parity.** The asserted embedding sum now uses signed shifts instead of integer multiplication by a power of two, and `PriorCore::validate` runs on constructed cores as well as loaded ones. A 12-context × 2-mode integer-score fixture plus seven greedy prompts (including the recorded loop states) is byte-identical before and after (`9bafc440…`), on the unchanged artifact `cd5a3aa1…`.

**Retained roots.** `/Users/casey.allard/uor-r4/.uor-models/realtext-prior-2026-09-20/eval-replay-2` — 14 sealed members (`result.json` SHA256 `6db96a1c…`, `data-manifest.json`, `fit-windows.bin` + index, `exposure.json`, `legacy-panel.json`, `spread-panel.json`, `permutation.json`, `references.json`, `generation.json`, `loops.json`, `fixtures.json`) — plus `parity-before` and `parity-after`. The original `attempt-1` sealed root and every negative generation are untouched. Evaluator source: `crates/uor-r4-core/src/bin/prior-frozen-evaluate.rs`.

**Withdrawn / preserved.** The historical complete-gate PASS, the 2.8744-bit penalty and its interval, the 5,805 applied-association count, "36 evaluated documents" and "three distinct generation documents" remain withdrawn. The positive loss improvement at step 512 (1.9174 bits over exact unigram, 1.9892 over the frozen quantized bias) is preserved, as are all negative generations. Steps 0 and 256 were never persisted as artifacts and are not replayed.

**One next mechanism.** Fit the bounded group-state/read component using the same hard integer forward that will be exported. Learn token actions from an eight-element exact palette with a declared categorical straight-through surrogate; compare to fixed actions and an equally parameterized tail-only arm. The protocol uses a single seed, 512 recovered fit windows, 256 batch-8 updates per arm with reader warm-up, and a predeclared development panel. It tests for predictive information in older token content with conditional state exchange preserving the exact local pair and older-prefix length. The low-bit component adds one width-16 readout; the original prior stays frozen. This is a hypothesis motivated by the roadmap, not a claimed remedy for the same-input count gap. Exact memory, selective forgetting, general language and 2I superiority remain separate obligations.

**Derived metadata corrections for that task:** 38,152 fit-window offsets use a global ID instead of the document-relative index; lengths/owners/byte offsets are valid, so measured losses and the 257,113-target exposure remain valid. Correct indices in a new claimed derived report, never the sealed original. Correct the permutation seed string to the actual seed/effective initialization and label the old eligible subset as changed-context records. These do not require repeating the complete replay.

**Resources:** projection, extension and charges are recorded in [the ledger](resource-ledger-2026-09-19.md). Peak RSS **289 MiB**, replay 52.5 s, new retained storage ≈27 MiB across the report and parity roots (within the 512 MiB tranche allowance and preserving the 128 MiB protected margin). No retained-real-text training update, deletion or paid/external compute. #973/#820/#963/#964 remain open.

**Shared-ledger reconciliation:** principal review found owner JSON still at `152238565 /154400000 ms` despite the merged 1,800,000 ms charge. Applied that previously recorded charge once: **`154038565 /154400000 ms`**, remaining **361435 ms (6.02 minutes)**. No new review charge or extension. The next prompt proposes a complete 5,400,000 ms local tranche and +5,400,000 ms limit increment, to refresh/record before execution under standing owner authorization. The previously released +1,000,000 ms is not active headroom.

These dated results retain their artifact and population scope. Their “next” instructions and resource snapshots are superseded by the active section above.

## Historical review after PR #1296 — learning-contract correction

**The #1296 instrument is partially implemented, not qualified.** Repair its common predictive forward, optimizer and synthetic target mask, verify an explicit low-bit capacity witness, then retry one small learned fitting gate. Run the authorized floating comparator only if that corrected gate fails. When the exported low-bit learning gate passes, complete schedule/checkpoint identity and continue the selected representative prior-only real-text curve within projected resources. The [principal review](learning-contract-review-2026-09-19.md), [complete DeepSeek prompt](deepseek-learning-contract-step-2026-09-19.md) and [roadmap dependencies](project-track.md#research-dependencies-and-exit-conditions) now own the next action.

### PR #1296 outcome with source corrections

Reviewed head `e5a29cf22506cb51bd7f2c44fe2a0045b82000ba` and merge `f4fc1c6089f4b047ec8feb92ba184c2f81bb077d` have identical tree `0010fd23b6813ffdc88f0dedeb666831d446444e`. The new `prior_learning.rs` supplies uncapped loss, an n−1 target iterator, a frozen low-bit bias and serialization/checkpoint machinery. Nine focused tests are reported passing. No new persisted trained artifact/manifest was delivered; real-text fitting and the floating comparator were NOT_RUN.

**The reported 0.375 is a score on a flawed fitting experiment.** Training scores every transition of `[x,y,s,x,y,s]`, s=(x+y)%4, while evaluation selects only `(x,y)->s`. Each non-prefix context receives addition twice and two subtraction targets once each. The exact empirical optimum with the current tie rule can score 14/16 on the selected addition positions, below the 0.9 gate. This does not impose a hard 14/16 accuracy ceiling; it invalidates the claim that the training objective uniquely asks for the evaluated mapping. The review gives the exact conditional counts and a consistent masked-triple replacement.

**Training/serving parity is still false.** The training forward leaves contextual readout R unscaled while applying the bias scale; served probabilities apply 2^-F to both. At F=10 this is a 1,024× contextual discrepancy. Backward nevertheless uses the scale. The shared Adam helper also discards updates when v_hat<=1e-12. The effects on the old score are not separately measured. A zero-output initialization test hides the scale error; nonzero-context probability/loss parity and independent derivatives are required.

**Remaining interfaces:** hash-modulo scheduling is not a without-replacement permutation; checkpoint serialization omits beta1/beta2/weight_decay and load discards data identity; resume tests compare only exported codes. The malformed-shift assertion uses `|| true` and mutates digest data. Loader metadata and arithmetic overflow bounds are incomplete. The old real-text runner/references do not use the new iterator. Claims of complete Stage 1, exact continuation-state equality and a fully bounded loader are withdrawn at this scope.

The prior's existing operations can represent the intended 16-pair map using a 16-feature ternary construction described in the review. That construction is mathematical, not executed here, and must remain separate from learned weights. Modulo element metadata in the new module is not used in prediction. The failed fixture establishes neither a geometric limitation nor a reason to replace the activation/architecture.

The [original receipt](../evidence/native_geometric_prior_recovery_2026-09-19.txt) remains verbatim evidence of the run and its claims; read it with this correction. Re-evaluating the retained CPR1 served artifact is possible under its original semantics; missing data affects exact-population replay, while the earlier training-bias mismatch affects reconstruction of training state. No chat, reasoning, coding, general prose or energy claim follows.

**Resources:** recorded live JSON `149838565 / 154400000 ms`, leaving `4561435 ms` (76.02 min). The preceding run's 800,000 ms charge is preserved, not independently reconstructed. This source/document/literature review ran no Rust build/model and applied no new charge or limit. The prompt proposes a complete 3,600,000 ms tranche, to refresh and record before use. Owner checkout and retained artifact SHA256 `fb780ff6ff19eec58f861135004250ae8874107099e2a071f7bfd1b4318b5a39` preserved. #973/#820 remain open; linked project items were absent at inspection.

## Historical recovery specification — review after PR #1294

**Do not launch an unchanged multi-epoch run.** The exact-token prior is implemented, but its paired pilot has loss-unit/clipping, training/export bias and data/control defects. Repair the numerical and target contracts, then train one prior-only contextual residual above a frozen fit-only quantized unigram baseline. Require a cheap balanced contextual-learning fixture, representative shuffled exposure, same-artifact context-permutation/position controls and a real resumable checkpoint. Memory remains disabled during fitting; diagnose the retained joint artifact without retraining it. The [principal review](prior-learning-review-2026-09-19.md) and [complete DeepSeek prompt](deepseek-prior-learning-step-2026-09-19.md) owned that recovery specification; the later #1296 correction above now owns the next action.

### PR #1294: implementation retained; pilot interpretation corrected

Merge `c0ca7482782a5d5e11d25aa8c6d5b03f0ce4cd07` and reviewed head `41213a558a12562406d2dca72e30a970da6b1a02` have identical tree `f93707884f4233a30c93f757dae22f2b8b3580e3`. `learner/cold_prior.rs` implements full-ID position tables, an absent-prefix row, bounded ReLU, causal modulo-pair memory, separate downshifts and a shared ternary decoder. The pilot repaired the old count argmax and geometric-core gradient reference. It reports 13 new focused tests plus two earlier gradient-reference tests; these do not establish exact training/export probability parity or independently validate the new gradient values.

**Metric correction:** the receipt's displayed losses use natural logarithms and probability flooring. They are clipped **nats/target**, not bits. Rounded arithmetic conversions follow; no model was rerun in this review.

| Scorer | Recorded clipped nats/target | Converted clipped bits/target, approximate |
| --- | ---: | ---: |
| Exact fit unigram | 6.4019 | 9.2360 |
| Quantized constant | 6.4522 | 9.3086 |
| Trained prior-only | 6.7011 | 9.6676 |
| Trained joint | 6.8941 | 9.9461 |
| Joint with memory disabled | 6.7006 | 9.6669 |

The negative point-estimate directions remain: the prior does not outperform the references, and memory increases clipped loss on the 294 warm targets by 4.4072 nats (approximately 6.3582 bits). Gate constants were also applied as nats. Warm coverage is 294/6,696 = 4.39%; that fraction alone is not an uncertainty calculation. The document bootstrap labeled 90% uses approximately 95% endpoints for a macro statistic, not the token-micro gate.

Training uses floating master bias while export rounds it to unrestricted i32. The target mask scores indices 1 through 62 in each length-64 window, so each arm sees 131,072 input tokens and 126,976 scored targets. Both consume the first 2,048 of 23,559 fit windows in document order; count references see the full fit population. Development takes document openings; 19 split documents yield 18 scored documents. The two-token count query lags its intended context by one position. A longer dose may help, but **undertraining as the cause, healthy activation scale and modulo aliasing as the cause of memory harm are unproven**. Separate downshifts do not guarantee balanced prior/memory magnitude.

**Preserved artifact:** `/Users/casey.allard/uor-r4/.uor-models/cold-prior-2026-09-19/cold_prior_joint.cpr`, 614,542 bytes, SHA256 `fb780ff6ff19eec58f861135004250ae8874107099e2a071f7bfd1b4318b5a39`; independently verified equal to `/tmp/cp6/cold_prior_joint.cpr`. Neither directory has a saved prior-only artifact, durable manifest, raw per-target results or optimizer checkpoint; CPR1 cannot faithfully resume the prior-only arm. Valid-artifact reload parity does not qualify loader range safety or training-forward parity.

Reported integer generation collapses largely to token IDs 28/39. The original [receipt](../evidence/native_geometric_cold_prior_pilot_2026-09-19.txt) is preserved verbatim, including its incorrect labels and unsupported interpretations; read this correction with it. No prose, chat, reasoning, coding, geometric advantage or energy claim follows. The [review](prior-learning-review-2026-09-19.md) lists source findings, missing controls and the targeted research refresh.

**Resources:** live JSON at review is `149038565 / 154400000 ms`, leaving `5361435 ms` (89.36 min). This source/document review ran no Rust build/model and changed no allowance or charge. The next prompt proposes a complete 3,600,000 ms tranche, not an executed charge. Refresh and record it before execution, revising under standing local-extension authorization when necessary. #973 and #820 remain open; no linked project-board items were present at inspection. Original checkout, artifact and historical results are preserved.

## Historical selected step: learned cold-context prior plus causal memory — before PR #1294

**Implement one bounded learned experiment:** exact-token position-specific prior rows, a bounded integer nonlinearity, the existing causal memory residual, and one shared low-bit decoder. Keep the prior present on cold and warm reads. Compare a trained prior-only model with the joint model, plus same-artifact interventions and bias/count references on one pinned population. See the [principal review](cold-context-review-2026-09-19.md) and [complete DeepSeek execution prompt](deepseek-cold-context-step-2026-09-19.md). At that review the mechanism was proposed; PR #1294 subsequently implemented it. The active recovery above now owns the next action.

**PR #1292 outcome retained with narrower interpretation.** Merge `5b5bc8f5` equals reviewed head `80e076bb` by full Git tree (`2e4168255fd10e71c23369af4794ed7c2148e57e`). Prefix-underflow and double-length-gradient repairs are sound. Causal empty fractions 0.9381 docs / 0.8549 crates and the default `12*p_empty` bound apply to their measured window population. This supports stopping the unchanged zero-prior configuration. It does not establish a matched inequality against static count CE measured on different held-document positions.

**Remaining source findings, fixes pending in the next task:** sparse argmax initializes its threshold from the unmixed unigram; the new analytic value-gradient reference has an extra row scale hidden by unit-scale fixtures; successor-statistic populations differ; BPB counts unscored prefix bytes. The six-step probe made updates, so its loss is post-probe rather than untrained; 512 input tokens correspond to 504 scored targets, and conversion timing excludes persisted checkpoint I/O. Raw receipts are preserved. The 40/44 test-count and abbreviated crates-digest discrepancies need raw-output recovery or explicit unavailable status. Retuned filter fixtures are development results, not independent preservation. The [review](cold-context-review-2026-09-19.md) gives exact source seams.

**Research direction.** The selected prior removes forced modulo aliases from the cold path; the existing adaptive memory remains modulo-aliased. A successful pilot would establish local contextual learning and, only if controlled gains support it, useful memory contribution. It would not establish distinctive H4/2I/zeta advantage, general chat, reasoning/coding, alpha or energy savings. Recent Engram/Lngram research supports a static/dynamic-memory distinction but does not supply a compliant standalone replacement. Keep the geometric programme and older exact-memory path distinct and preserved.

**Resource snapshot:** recorded JSON `147638565 / 154400000 ms`, leaving `6761435 ms` (112.69 min). This source/documentation review performed no Rust build or model run, charged no model time and changed no limit. Reused an existing isolated full worktree; original checkout/artifacts preserved. Next task has a proposed complete 3,600,000 ms tranche to project before use and refine from new-path timing. Necessary recorded local extensions remain owner-authorized; no paid compute/deletion. #973 remains active/open, #820 programme/open; neither has linked GitHub project items at inspection.

## Causal qualification done: the cold-route floor rules this configuration out before any fit — September 19, 2026 (takeover tranche)

**THE BOUNDED #973 TASK IS COMPLETE AND ITS RESULT IS A NEGATIVE, REACHED BEFORE SPENDING A TRAINING BLOCK: DO NOT TRAIN THIS CONFIGURATION.** The task's own frozen failure branch was "if the cold-route loss floor already exceeds the frozen development target, or useful reads are too rare to train the intended function, stop scaling this configuration." Both conditions hold on both corpora.

**Two source defects confirmed and fixed.** (1) `tail_word` / `word_at` / `sequence_loss` computed `len + k - order` and `i + k + 1 - order` on `usize`, which underflows for a prefix shorter than the word — a panic under overflow checks and a silent wrap in release. One checked padding contract now serves the served path, the loss and the trainer. (2) The value and kernel gradients divided by the sequence length **twice**: `g = p * inv` at the readout already converts the summed loss to the mean, and `gkernel += acc * inv` / `gwv += dscratch * inv` applied it again (63× at n=64). The extra factors are removed and verified against **two independent analytic references**, the order-2 exact read (value gradient as an explicit suffix sum) and the order-1 kernel convolution.

**The gradient fix has a measured behavioural cost, and it is recorded rather than smoothed over.** My change; it also changed two pre-existing synthetic filter fixtures at their recorded seeds: `corruption_in_the_objective_changes_the_filter` went 0.13 → 0.10 and `a_general_filter_is_at_least_as_good_as_a_class_filter` went 0.27 → 0.09. Both pass again only after re-tuning their learning rate (0.05 → 0.15 and 0.05 → 0.5), and at the re-tuned rates the general-filter margin is 0.11 versus 0.09 against a 0.02 tolerance — a **tie, not the previously recorded "does not lose"**. The earlier filter accuracies are superseded at their recorded scope and the general-filter capacity claim is **not** validated at that budget.

**The decisive measurement.** Replaying the trainer's actual write-then-read order on real text at `V=4096`, `order=2`, state reset per window:

```
docs   64-token windows: p_empty 0.9381 (first 8 positions 0.9946) → floor 11.2575 bits/token
       128: p_empty 0.8972 → 10.7664      256: p_empty 0.8459 → 10.1510
crates 64-token windows: p_empty 0.8549 → 10.2586 bits/token
```

An empty route is the zero vector, the default readout has no bias, and its loss is exactly `log2(4096) = 12` bits/token. So the default path's mean loss is at least `p_empty · 12` — **11.26 bits/token on prose**, above the unigram baseline (9.22) and far above the best static backoff baseline (6.33). Only 6.2 % of prose positions read a previously-written route, the first eight positions of every window are cold with probability ≈0.994, and the routes that are written are near-unique (distinct exact contexts per address ≈1.004, distinct successors ≈1.002). Vector cancellation was 0/388 under a **named, seeded** initialisation, explicitly not a trained result.

**Timing measured, replacing both unmeasured figures.** One `train_batch` at `V=4096`, `dv=128`, `order=2`, batch 8 × window 64 covers both full-table quantizations, the touched-bucket reset, forward, backward and Adam: **cold 0.5602 s, warm 0.5649 s, 512 tokens/step, 906 tokens/s, peak RSS 56.3 MiB**. The recorded 1,800 s projection assumed ~2,278 tokens/s and is ~2.5× optimistic; the later "3–10× slower" arithmetic was pessimistic. Both are superseded.

**The count instrument is repaired without erasing prior output.** It is relabelled a **static backoff comparison**, not a ceiling: the residues select the bucket, but the bucket holds prefix-accumulated values, so `[0,1,2,0,1]` and `[0,1,3,0,1]` share an address yet differ — the earlier "the entire context is the residue pair" claim is withdrawn. CE and top-1 now come from the **same** interpolated distribution with a `lambda = 0` unigram fixture, accuracy is computed once at the final weights rather than inside the tuning sweep, and the protocol is explicit: **counts are fit on the fit split only**, weights tuned on the disjoint validation split, **no full-training refit**. Corrected numbers (new corpus snapshot): docs `res2` 6.3310 / `true2` 5.2551; crates `res2` 5.0402 / `true2` 4.2007 bits/token.

**What is missing, named.** A **learned cold-context prior**: the reset state holds no corpus statistics, so a cold route cannot fall back to anything, while the count baselines carry global priors the empty bucket does not. The proposed smallest intervention is a learned cold-context prediction trained through the same discrete path with an explicit fallback marker and matched ablations — not more `dv` or steps, because an injective map from 4,096 tokens to 120 single roots is impossible. The `order`-2 radix read still exercises no group multiplication, zeta phase or chirality, and is not evidence about the distinctive geometry.

**State.** New tools `geometric-realtext-coverage.rs` and `geometric-realtext-train-probe.rs`; the 4,096-vocabulary derivation is single-sourced in `transformerless::bpe_derive`. `geometric_attention` 44 tests pass under overflow checks, including 8 new qualification fixtures and 2 independent gradient references; `cargo fmt --all --check` clean; claim-wording gate passes. No pilot was run and no model artifact was created.

## Takeover reconciliation: qualify causal learning before the real-text block — September 19, 2026

**Active next action:** repair/qualify causal state, short-prefix arithmetic, declared STE gradients and count-metric semantics; measure real-text route coverage; then measure full trainer step time and admit a small pilot only if informative. Use the [complete DeepSeek execution prompt](deepseek-next-step-2026-09-19.md) and [takeover investigation](takeover-review-2026-09-19.md). This supersedes earlier same-day “ceiling,” “BUILD IT,” testbed-exhaustion and timing-first scheduling below. Existing receipts remain preserved; no model was run in this source/documentation review.

**Owner authority:** D0-b/D1/D2 are owner-approved and reconfirmed. Offline Rust matmul is allowed. Bounded <=4-bit additive/shift/lookup linear maps are allowed at serving with no multiplier instruction in the declared numerical kernel and no floating point in served computation. Geometric routing remains preferred. The stable policy/AGENTS now reflect this; old blanket mathematical-contraction exclusions are historical.

**Most consequential correction:** the last two residues select the order-2 bucket, but the bucket contains learned successor values accumulated from the prefix. The static fitted residue count scores (5.0019 source / 5.9546 prose bits/token) are useful development baselines, not an information-theoretic upper bound on recurrent prediction. Unwritten default buckets produce zero logits/uniform predictions, exactly 12 bits/token at V=4096. Measure their frequency under the actual 64-token reset policy before a large fit. The group-composition path is separate from this radix-pair read; its real-text geometric contribution remains unmeasured.

**Source findings, execution pending:** short-prefix unsigned underflow in `tail_word`/`word_at`/`sequence_loss`; apparent second length normalization in value/kernel gradients; count-tool interpolation/top-1, refit and byte-denominator discrepancies. The current trainer clears touched buckets, not a dense state every sequence, but re-quantizes both full tables inside each sequence. Both the 1,800-second projection and the later 3–10x estimate remain unmeasured. See the review for precise source and appropriate checks.

**Keep model paths separate:** historical exact-memory/dependent-language, TinyStories `.rgm`, and the new `GeometricAttention` core. The September 17 role repair is rule-assisted open-development repair; the old retention suite does not qualify either newer model. Continuous 1.2372 BPB is not the served scorer; discrete/shortlist receipts have different values and scopes. No general prose/chat, generalized reasoning/coding, new-core allocation qualification or complete-path energy advantage is established.

**Recovery snapshot:** clean main/origin at `127c0eaf`; #1290 merged, #1284 already merged, no open PRs at audit start. Recorded time `146438565 / 154400000 ms`, remaining `7961435 ms` (132.69 min); no model charge or limit change for this review. The [ledger reconciliation](resource-ledger-2026-09-19.md) repairs ordering while exposing remaining receipt/arithmetic discrepancies rather than fabricating charges. Storage inventory: 51.76 GB free; model-store 20.44 GB is a lower bound due to three unreadable sealed paths, all preserved. Refresh before execution.

## The reduced form says BUILD IT: the order-2 residue context carries most of the bigram signal — September 19, 2026

**THE FUNDED REAL-TEXT BLOCK WAS ABOUT TO BE SPENT WITHOUT KNOWING WHAT IT COULD POSSIBLY MEASURE. THE REDUCED FORM WAS TESTED FIRST, IT CONTRADICTED THE STRUCTURAL PRIOR, AND IT TURNED THE BLOCK FROM DOUBTFUL INTO TARGETED.**

Before spending the recorded 2-hour real-text projection on "train the geometric core at `V=4096`, `dv=128` for ~2,000 steps", the mechanism's addressing was inspected. It is fixed and not learned: `element_table` is `token_id % 120` (`learner/geometric_attention.rs`), both `from_f32` and `GeometricAttentionTrainer::new` set `elements` from it, and `order` is restricted to `{1, 2}`. So at `order = 2` the entire prediction context is `(t-2 mod 120, t-1 mod 120)` — a `120² = 14,400`-class coalescing of the two-token context, ~34 tokens per residue. Trap #2 requires the reduced form before the build, and here the reduced form is information-theoretic: the best any predictor can do from that context, so a **ceiling** on what any amount of training of this mechanism can reach.

**Two estimator defects caught by the controls, one of which would have been a false positive for the mechanism.** A first version smoothed each context with add-1 over 4,096 tokens. With true order-2 contexts observed ~16 times on average the additive mass dominates, so the *true* bigram scored **worse** than the unigram-plus-one-token model (`true2` 7.5891 vs `true1` 6.2749 bits/token) — impossible for a real bigram — and the invalid instrument reported the residue context as recovering **"102.28 %"** of the true order-2 gain. Its shuffle control also compared a real-trained model against shuffled text instead of refitting. Both were fixed: Jelinek–Mercer interpolation down a backoff chain with weights tuned on a validation split, and a shuffled corpus **refit end to end**.

**Measured.** Two real corpora (the repository's own source, and its Markdown prose), 4 MiB each, corpus pinned by sha256, held out every 10th document:

```
corpus 1 (source)  unigram 8.7520 | res1 6.5785 | res2 5.0019 | true1 5.1736 | true2 4.1573   bits/token
                   bits/byte: unigram 3.4727 res1 2.6103 res2 1.9847 true1 2.0528 true2 1.6496
corpus 2 (prose)   unigram 9.0957 | res1 7.3446 | res2 5.9546 | true1 5.7979 | true2 4.8955   bits/token
                   bits/byte: unigram 3.6292 res1 2.9305 res2 2.3759 true1 2.3134 true2 1.9533
control (shuffled corpus, refit): every gain 0.0000 bits/token; tuning selects lambda = 0
```

**The structural prior was wrong.** It predicted a ~34:1 coalescing would destroy the context. Instead the residue pair recovers **81.6 % (source) and 74.8 % (prose)** of the true order-2 gain, and two residues match or beat one real token. The hypothesis — unmeasured — is frequency skew: ids are assigned in merge order, so they correlate with frequency, so each residue class is dominated by one or two frequent tokens and acts as a noisy proxy for that token. Consistently the residue contexts are far better sampled (res2 mean 87.4 vs true2 mean 16.2 obs) yet the true levels still win. **This is a ceiling**: ternary weights, a power-of-two normalised read and `dv = 128` value vectors over a 4,096-token readout can only be worse, and the gap is unmeasured.

**What this changes.** The funded block is **not** killed; it now has a target band — compare the trained core against `res2` = 5.00 bits/token / 1.98 bits/byte (source) and 5.95 / 2.38 (prose), with `true2` = 4.16 / 1.65 and 4.90 / 1.95 as the ceiling of the context it actually has. **And it exposes a cost problem the recorded projection does not carry.** From the project's own counted readout (262,144 ops/token at `dv=64`, doubling to 524,288 at `dv=128`) and 4.096e6 tokens, the forward readout alone is 2.15e12 operations; the recorded 1,800 s corresponds to ~1.2e9 scalar ops/s sustained with no room for the backward pass, Adam over `2 × vocab × dv` weights, the write path or the 1.84e6-int state clear. The run is plausibly **3–10× the recorded projection**, and the ~132 min remaining may not cover 2,000 steps at this configuration. That figure is arithmetic from op counts, not a timing measurement.

**State.** New tool `crates/uor-r4-core/src/bin/geometric-realtext-ceiling.rs`; `cargo fmt --check` clean; 3 focused tests pass (truncation keeps exactly the dense prefix and its merges; an over-large request is rejected; a non-dense prefix is rejected). Nothing regressed; no model artifact was created.

**Next action.** (1) A measured step-time probe of `GeometricAttentionTrainer` at `V=4096`, `dv=128`, `order=2` before any block is spent, so the run length is chosen from a timing and not from the 1,800 s projection. (2) Then the real-text harness (`u16` packing already exists via `mmap_corpus`; the 4096 tokenizer derivation is now in the new tool) and the run, against the band above. (3) `learned packaging` of the element assignment remains the mechanism fix if the trained model falls far below the ceiling.

## The synthetic-task well is exhausted as an instrument; the real-text path is next — September 19, 2026

**THREE CONSECUTIVE MECHANISMS CONVERGE ON THE SAME CONCLUSION, AND IT IS A PROPERTY OF THE TESTBED.**

- The **bounded shortlist** (the compute lever: the readout is 99.9748% of per-token work; a fanout-8 depth-4 shortlist projects **480× fewer operations**) **cannot have its accuracy cost measured** here — on synthetic tasks the address *determines* the answer, so a shortlist keyed on the address is trivially exact and the trade-off vanishes.
- The **hyperbolic substrate** can only be judged on whether it represents a *hierarchy* at equal fidelity with fewer dimensions, which needs real structure to have a hierarchy over.
- **Curvature typing** has nothing to predict while address collisions are zero.

**Conclusion: further mechanism measurement on the synthetic testbed cannot change a decision.** The instrument has done its work — it found the recurrence instability, the address collision, the read-activation defect, the identity-class defect, the objective-level reason the learned filter fails, and it established that composition carries capability (0.42 vs 0.00 on unseen facts) and that abstention converts hallucination into honesty (0/64/0). What it cannot do is discriminate *cost-versus-accuracy* trades, because its answers are structural rather than statistical.

**Next block: the real-text path** — a 4096-vocabulary tokenizer derived from the local `tokenizer.json` (the shipped model's resolution), an instruction corpus, packed `u16` sequences, a training run on the geometric core, then held-out evaluation **and the raw generations read aloud**. Projection recorded in the ledger per the standing authorization: **2 hours (7,200,000 ms)**, updated limit 154,400,000 ms, **not spent in this session**.

**Also reverted from the roadmap on this evidence:** hyperbolic arithmetic at serving (costs more per operation than an add); R8 expansion for accuracy (precision is measured as not the accuracy constraint); Hamming as a semantic similarity metric (already falsified in-project). The hierarchy survives in its useful form — **bounding the readout** — and that claim is a projection with an unmeasured accuracy cost, labelled as such in the receipt, the test, `EVIDENCE.md` and here.

## Per-token compute counted: the readout is 99.97%, and that is where the hierarchy pays — September 19, 2026

**THE COMPUTE LEVER IS THE READOUT, NOT THE GEOMETRY. COUNTED, NOT PROJECTED.**

The owner's compute questions (can hyperbolic geometry or a deeper routing hierarchy save massive compute?) needed to know where the compute is, which had never been counted. Operations for the served path in its served configuration (`order = 2`, `vocab = 4096`, `dv = 64`):

```
address=2   read_exact=64   read_graded=7,680   readout=262,144
readout share of per-token work: 99.9748% (exact read) | 97.1530% (graded read)
```

**The read — the entire point of the geometric mechanism — is 0.03% to 2.8% of the work.** The vocabulary read dominates by three to four orders of magnitude.

**Projection from counted ops (not a built system):** a fanout-8 depth-4 route with a shortlist of `k = 8` costs `8·64 + 8·4 + 2 = 546` ops/token against 262,210 — **480× fewer operations**.

**Why the accuracy half is not settled:** on the synthetic relational task the address *determines* the answer, so a shortlist keyed on the address is trivially exact and the trade-off vanishes. The shortlist's real cost — generalisation lost when candidates are pruned — needs data where the address is not the answer's identity, i.e. **the real-text path**.

**What this changes.** The compute lever is the **readout** — consistent with the accuracy side of this session, where five readout levers were flat: the readout is simultaneously the cost bottleneck and not the accuracy bottleneck. The project's invariant **I3 (“candidates scored per token ≪ vocabulary”) is where the large factors live**; the old artifact path already has a 64-candidate shortlist and the new geometric core has none, which is the gap. The hierarchy proposal survives in its useful form — bounding the readout, ~480× in projection — not as hyperbolic arithmetic, which costs *more* per operation.

**A seventh would-be defect, recorded rather than reported.** A first wall-clock comparison gave 264 µs (readout) vs 33 µs (write+read), which looks like support — but the write+read side was dominated by zeroing a 3.7 MB state buffer (14400 × 64 ints), not by the read. That comparison measured allocation and is not evidence. Op counts are build-independent; wall-clock is not, so wall-clock is not used here.

**Next action.** The shortlist's accuracy cost is the open question and it needs the real-text path (BPE-4096 + instruction corpus). Until then the 480× is a projection with an unmeasured cost, and is labelled as such everywhere.

## Spherical-harmonic grounding and a graded group kernel — September 19, 2026

**THE OWNER'S HARMONIC INTUITION HAS AN EXACT FINITE FORM HERE: PETER–WEYL ON 2I. THE GRADED KERNEL WORKS, AND THE ATTEMPT EXPOSED TWO MORE MEASUREMENT DEFECTS.**

**Exact form.** For a finite group, conjugation-invariant functions — functions of the *relative* element `r(q,g) = inverse(q)·g`, the descriptor the September-13 synthesis named — form a space whose dimension is the number of conjugacy classes, spanned by the irreducible characters. That is this group's harmonic band count. Computed from the project's own verified table: **2I has 9 conjugacy classes, sizes `[1, 1, 12, 12, 12, 12, 20, 20, 30]`**, with conjugation-invariance checked directly over all 14,400 `(g,h)` pairs. So a graded read kernel `w[class(inverse(q)·g)]` is the **maximally compact rotation-invariant kernel this group admits: nine ternary weights rather than 120.**

**Mechanism.** Added a `graded_read`: `y = Σ_g w[class(q⁻¹g)]·S[g]` with **ternary** `w`, so the read is conditional adds/subtracts only. With weight on the identity class it reproduces the exact read `S[q]`.

**Measured.** Corrupt the query address by a fixed group element and weight the kernel on that element's conjugacy class; averaged over five corruption elements, held out, deterministic seeds (`vocab` 120, `dv` 64, 900 steps):

```
graded kernel over 5 corruptions: clean exact=0.55 soft=0.15 | corrupted exact=0.13 soft=0.23
```

A class-function kernel **recovers a corrupted query, 0.13 → 0.23 (≈1.8×)**, because it pools over group-near stored elements where the exact read looks in exactly one wrong bucket. It pays with clean accuracy, 0.55 → 0.15. **The kernel is hand-set, not learned**, so this is a lower bound on what a trained kernel could trade.

**Two defects found by the new checks.** (1) **The identity of 2I is element 1, not element 0** — `exact_kernel` weighted an arbitrary singleton class, so the first graded measurement (clean 0.19; corrupted 0.13 → 0.23) was **invalid and re-measured**; §3 of the receipt is the corrected result, and `exact_kernel` now takes the identity class explicitly. (2) A **vacuous test**: `graded_exact_kernel_equals_the_bucket_read` initially compared two empty vectors and passed; it now requires a non-empty bucket and a query-dependent read. **This is the second time in two sessions that a measurement defect looked like a mechanism result**; the non-vacuity guard is now in the test.

**Focused tests pass** (18 `geometric_attention`); `cargo fmt --check` clean.

**Next action.** (1) **Learn the kernel** — nine ternary weights, gradient available in closed form (`∂L/∂w[c] = Σ_{g∈c} Σ_j dnum_j·S[g][j]`), write path unchanged; prediction: a learned kernel keeps most clean accuracy while retaining the corruption benefit, and if it cannot then the trade-off is structural and should be recorded as such. (2) Then **BPE-4096 and a real instruction corpus**, where the next honest signal has to come from.

**Attempted and negative: learning the filter does not work from clean data, and the reason is the objective.** Implemented the learnable ternary kernel (STE + Adam, read as a group convolution, per-step state caching) and measured it against the fixed exact filter:

```
fixed   kernel=[0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0] clean=0.42 corrupted=0.13
learned kernel=[1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0] clean=0.14 corrupted=0.14
```

Trained on clean addresses only, the filter **spreads over neighbouring classes and loses clean accuracy without gaining corrupted accuracy** — because the training objective contains no address corruption, so robustness to it is not learnable from that objective. The spread filter's benefit is real (0.13 → 0.23 hand-set, §3) but must be *chosen* or trained with corruption in the objective. The change also regressed five tests in the trainer's read path, so it was **reverted**; the file is back at its verified 18/18 state and the diagnosis is retained rather than the regressing code.

**Where the owner's wider concept already lands, and what is missing.** *Superposition storage* over the group — `S = Σ_g c_g·δ_g` with the read a convolution against a filter — is **present** (classical superposition over a Lie-group basis, not quantum). *Backpropagation in that basis* is **present**: the suffix-sum gradient is exactly the adjoint of the convolution. *Lie-group packaging* is **partly present** (exact composition via the verified table; the ordered word packs context into a group element) but the element assignment is still a fixed function of the token id. *Harmonic compute* is **partly present** (a band-limited class-function filter) but a general non-class filter and multiple bands are missing.

**Next honest steps, in order:** (1) put corrupted addresses in the training objective and re-test the learned filter — the diagnosis predicts that is what makes it work; (2) a general (non-class) group-algebra filter; (3) learned packaging of the element assignment; (4) then BPE-4096 and real text.

**Corruption in the objective: diagnosis confirmed, filter still not worth it.** Step (1) was done — an optional `corrupt_frac` displaces the query address by a random group element during training, the filter is now learnable (`learn_kernel`, own clip group):

```
corrupt 0.0: kernel=[1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0] clean=0.11 corrupted=0.12
corrupt 0.5: kernel=[1,1,0,1,1,1,0,1,0] clean=0.27 corrupted=0.13
```

Corruption in the objective **does** change the filter (spreads 3 → 7 classes) and **does** raise corrupted accuracy (0.12 → 0.13); clean also rises (0.11 → 0.27) as a regularisation effect. **But the fixed exact filter reaches clean 0.42 on the same budget**, so every learned variant is worse on clean and only marginally better under corruption. Honest reading: **a spread filter pays only if address corruption is part of the deployment distribution**; +0.01 corrupted against −0.15 clean is not a default trade.

**Two more defects found and fixed**, both invisible in aggregate numbers and visible only as regressions in unrelated tests: (a) `order = 2` addresses are pair indices, not group elements, so the inverse lookup indexed a 120-entry table with a value up to 14,399 — an out-of-bounds panic in six tests; it is now guarded to `order = 1`. (b) The filter's gradient was folded into the matrices' global clip norm, which altered every existing training result; the nine filter weights are now clipped in their own group.

**State.** `geometric_attention` **19 passed, 0 failed**; `cargo fmt --check` clean. The learned filter is retained as an option with defaults preserving previously verified behaviour, so nothing regressed.

**Receipt:** [`native_geometric_spherical_harmonic_kernel_2026-09-19.txt`](../evidence/native_geometric_spherical_harmonic_kernel_2026-09-19.txt).

**Step (2) done: the general group-algebra filter buys nothing — the bottleneck is not the filter.** The filter can now be a class function (9 slots, conjugation-invariant) or a general group-algebra element (120 slots), selectable by `class_filter`; the general case contains the class case as a subspace.

```
class filter:   slots=9   non_zero=3  clean=0.11
general filter: slots=120 non_zero=5  clean=0.11
```

A 13× increase in filter capacity changes nothing: training uses 5 of 120 slots and reaches the same accuracy, and both remain far below the **fixed exact filter's clean 0.42**. **Filter capacity, expressiveness and conjugation-invariance are all immaterial to clean accuracy here**, so whatever limits the learned variants is upstream of the read — in the stored representation or the readout. That is now the measurement's own conclusion, not a preference, and it makes **learned packaging** the next step on evidence rather than on taste.

**State.** `geometric_attention` **20 passed, 0 failed**; `cargo fmt --check` clean.

**Relational generalisation: the first task where the group is load-bearing.** Learned packaging cannot be tested on a copy task — relabelling group elements is a symmetry of the architecture, so with no collisions and no meaningful proximity every injective assignment behaves identically. The task must reward group *structure*, so one was built: token `w < 120` has meaning = its own element of 2I, token `120 + j` is a relation with element `j + 1`, and the fact `(w, h_j) → compose(w, h_j)` is **defined by the group**, so an unseen pair still has a well-defined answer. Each sequence lists several facts then queries one pair; the answer is not adjacent to the query and appears nowhere else in the prompt; held-out pairs are never used as a fact in training. Held out, `dv = 64`, 900 steps:

```
context lookup:      seen-query=0.39  unseen-query=0.00
composed dictionary: seen-query=0.39  unseen-query=0.42
```

**A context-address lookup scores 0.00 on unseen relational facts — it cannot generalise, which is the falsification half.** The composed read — package the vocabulary by meaning, then address `compose(elem(w), elem(h))` — answers unseen facts at **0.42 against 0.00** and has **no generalisation gap** (0.42 unseen vs 0.39 seen), because the query is *computed* rather than retrieved. **This is the first result this session where the group structure is load-bearing rather than decorative.**

**The remaining ceiling is the readout, not the mechanism.** Both mechanisms sit at the same ~0.4 on facts they can reach — the same readout limit measured twice already (the fixed exact filter's 0.42; the learned filter's inability to beat it). Composition removes the generalisation gap entirely; what remains is mapping 120 value vectors to 120 classes. That makes the **readout** the single binding constraint on every mechanism tested, and the clearest next target.

*(An earlier version of this task was a literal repeat of each fact and scored 1.00 on "unseen" facts — the answer sat beside the query and could be copied. A leak, caught by a failing test, and the second task-design error this session; both initially looked like successes.)*

**Four levers ruled out — the ceiling is not resolution, budget, width or filter capacity.** The recommended step was to fix the readout on the theory that its resolution caused the ~0.3–0.4 ceiling. Tested falsify-first with an **unquantised-readout oracle** before building anything (D0-b permits 4-bit weights, so a 4-bit shift-and-add readout would have been the build if the oracle showed headroom):

```
serving readout:    ternary=0.28  unquantised=0.28
relational budget:  steps=900 0.28 | steps=4000 0.28
read width:         dv=64 0.28 | dv=256 0.28
filter capacity:    9 slots 0.11 | 120 slots 0.11
```

**All four are flat.** Weight precision, training budget, read width and filter capacity each fail to move the ceiling, so the 4-bit kernel build is **not** recommended on this evidence and the reason is recorded. *(The first oracle was wrong — it changed only training while evaluation still used the ternary readout — and was rebuilt to compare at evaluation on identical masters; that is the third diagnostic defect this session. A second defect, a dictionary polluted by relation tokens colliding with word elements, was also found and fixed.)*

**What this rules in.** The ceiling is structural in the readout **mechanism** — one linear map over one read vector decoding 120 classes — not in its width, precision, the filter, the addressing or the budget. The natural next candidate is a **non-linear / table decode**: the project's own nearest-root decoder over the 120 canonical roots, which is exact, multiplier-free by construction (compare plus table read, not a contraction), and is listed in the project synthesis under exact finite geometric actions. That is a different *kind* of readout, which is what the evidence now points at.

**State.** `geometric_attention` **25 passed, 0 failed**; `cargo fmt --check` clean; nothing regressed.

## Ordered-word addressing recovers the collapse; context copy reaches 100% — September 19, 2026

**THE PROJECT'S ORDERED-N-LET FORMALISM WORKS: THE COLLAPSE IS RECOVERED AND THE MATCHED-FILTER BASELINE IS LEFT AT ZERO.**

Owner direction was to synthesise the wider toolset before implementing. Three findings changed or confirmed the plan. (1) The project's **September-13 attention synthesis** had already selected H1 (structured geometric recurrent learner with relation-preserving reads) and named the **directed relative element `r(i,j) = inverse(g_i)·g_j`** as the descriptor to prefer over a scalar distance — precisely the ordered-word idea this session derived from measurement. (2) That synthesis predates D0-b and says a published MatMul-free model's ternary accumulation "is a matrix product under this project's stronger rule"; **that was the D0-a reading, superseded by owner-signed D0-b**, which explicitly permits bounded integer/ternary linear maps with no multiplier in the kernel. `LowBitAttention` is legal under D0-b and would not have been under D0-a; the conflict is recorded, not hidden. (3) W33/NEMESIS supply no replacement attention rule (their own dossier says so), but W33's **ordered-operation principle** (`PLPL = LPLP`, `Ω = LP − PL`, `ker(Ω)` order-insensitive) transferred and worked.

**Change.** `GeometricAttention` now addresses by an **ordered word** of `order` tokens over the 120 elements of `2I` — `order = 2` gives 120² = 14,400 ordered addresses with `(a,b) ≠ (b,a)` by construction. Positional radix composition of 2I elements; table reads and index arithmetic, no multiplier.

**The falsifiable prediction from the previous round is confirmed.** Task and alphabet fixed; only word length changes:

| measurement | order = 1 | order = 2 |
|---|---:|---:|
| duplicated-key accuracy | 0.14 | **0.98** |
| clean accuracy | 0.44 | **1.00** |

**Context copy (held out, deterministic seeds):**

| context | order=1 | **order=2** | linear attention |
|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| 4 | 0.86 | **1.00** | 0.05 |
| 8 | 0.64 | **1.00** | 0.03 |
| 16 | 0.47 | **1.00** | 0.00 |

**Two earlier ablations moved back to `order = 1`, explicitly.** Both are true and both are now unresolvable at `order = 2` because the task saturates at 1.00: the `relu`-after-read cost (order=2: 0.95 vs 1.00, below threshold; order=1: 0.31 vs 0.64) and the resolution scaling (order=2: 1.00 vs 1.00; order=1: 0.64 vs 0.80). Recorded rather than silently weakened — a saturated task is not evidence of absence.

**A defect found and corrected mid-change.** The refactor's first run gave 0.00 everywhere, including `order = 1` where 0.86 was known. Cause: `tail_word` was off by one (read index `len` instead of `len − 1`), so `forward_i32` and therefore the accuracy metric read the wrong bucket — **training was correct and the measurement was not.** All results above are post-fix. Recorded because a measurement bug that mimics a mechanism failure is the exact error class this project has been burned by.

**SpiralCore mathematics indexed into project knowledge** (owner request). Mechanical extraction of the preserved HTML, SHA-256 verified against the preserved copy: **33 sections, 49,066 characters** — dodecahedral/icosahedral network, six H2 decagons, 3-fold axes, addressing schema, E8 operator subnet routing, LADA ports (D4/F4), stabilizer/inversion angle-invariance, Bell 2-of-6 codec, Clifford complement, FBS binder tree, orbit/route traces, route directional-spread witness, core-edge effective resistance, scope ledger. Extract at `research/spiralcore-v68/spiralcore-v68-mathematics-extract.txt`; ingested as **34 items / 33 edges**; retrieval verified through the knowledge service. Faithful text extraction, not endorsement; formulas carried as HTML markup may be degraded, and the preserved HTML remains the source of record.

**Focused tests pass** (14 `geometric_attention`); `cargo fmt --check` clean.

**Next action.** (1) **Harden the measurement before claiming more**: the task now saturates at 1.00, so raise alphabet and run length until `order = 2` stops scoring 1.00, then re-measure `order = 2` vs `order = 3` there — a mechanism measured only on a task it aces is not measured. (2) **Graded group kernel** — the other half of the project's `r(i,j)` formalism: read neighbouring group elements with partial weight `w[class(q⁻¹g)]` so a query can match a *near* word. (3) Then BPE-4096 and a real instruction-data run.

**Saturation caveat closed.** Difficulty was raised by shrinking the alphabet until ordered *pairs* repeat with different successors (context 16, dv 64):

| alphabet | order=1 | order=2 |
|---:|---:|---:|
| 4 | 0.34 | **0.62** |
| 8 | 0.25 | **0.84** |
| 16 | 0.42 | **0.97** |
| 32 | 0.55 | **1.00** |

The ordered-pair address wins at every difficulty and the margin grows as words become unique (+0.28, +0.59, +0.55, +0.45); at alphabet 4 both ceilings are gone and it still doubles `order = 1`. Pinned as `ordered_words_win_at_every_difficulty`. `order = 1` also improves with a larger alphabet (0.34 → 0.55) because single tokens then repeat less often — two different collisions, both visible in the data.

## Geometric addressed memory: an interference-free, multiplier-free attention, measured — September 19, 2026

**THE PROJECT'S OWN THESIS — EXACT ADDRESSED MEMORY — SHOWS A MEASURED ADVANTAGE OVER THE SOFT-MATCHED-FILTER ALTERNATIVE; NEITHER SOLVES THE TASK YET.**

New `learner/geometric_attention.rs`, built on the owner's direction to push the project's mathematics rather than fall back on linear attention. Design: `S[addr(prev)] += value(cur)` and `y = norm(S[addr(query)])`, then `W_o · relu(y)`. The address is a **table read**, the write is an **add**, the read is a **table read**, and the normalisation is a **bit scan plus a shift** — multiplier-free throughout, at `O(dv)` per token against linear attention's `O(dk·dv)`. Addresses are elements of the machine-checked 2I group (the 120 canonical H4 roots composed through `learner/group_table.rs`); two composed factors give 120² = 14,400 addresses (13.8 bits), the transition plan's `H4^k` product-code lever on the existing table.

**Measured, held out, deterministic seeds, one layer.** Context repetition (a random run `R`, then `R` again; the second copy is only predictable from memory of `prev → next`):

| context | geometric (exact address) | linear attention |
|---:|---:|---:|
| 4 | **0.69** | 0.05 |
| 8 | **0.31** | 0.03 |
| 16 | **0.02** | 0.00 |

The direction is the one theory predicts — exact addressing removes the cross-talk that limits a matched filter. **But the honest reading is that both mechanisms fail this task at this scale, and the exact-addressing variant fails less.** A 0.05 baseline is at chance for 32 classes, so "beats linear attention" is a weak claim and is recorded as such.

**Negatives, recorded before any claim.** It does not solve the task (0.69 at context 4, 0.02 at 16). More training does not help (900 → 3000 steps: 0.69 → 0.66, 0.31 → 0.20), so the ceiling is a mechanism limit, not a budget. The confirmed power-of-two readout normalisation had **no measurable effect here** (0.69 → 0.69) — it is retained as correct conditioning, but the binding limit is elsewhere. The address assignment is **fixed**, not learned (as the project itself initialises `token_to_root`); capacity is bounded by `n_addr`.

**Focused tests pass** (11 `geometric_attention`): the integer serving path equals the `f64` reference exactly; 64 tokens map to 64 distinct addresses; gradients reach both tables; and exact addressing beats the matched filter at every context length. `cargo fmt --check` clean.

**Likely causes of the ceiling, in order:** ternary `dv = 32` value/output tables give the readout limited resolution for 32 classes; and a first-order (bigram) memory cannot represent longer structure.

**Next action.** (1) Raise `dv` 32 → 128 at fixed everything else: if accuracy rises with `dv` the limit is readout resolution and the mechanism scales, otherwise it is the first-order address design and product factors are required. (2) Learn the address factors (`H4^k`, Stage 3) instead of fixing them. (3) Compose rather than choose — the exact-address memory and the matrix-state core solve different problems (associative recall vs contextual integration), so a layer that reads both is the natural next architecture. The move to the project BPE is confirmed and is queued for the next training run, after conditioning.

**The ceiling was the read activation, not capacity — and it is fixed.** The owed `dv` diagnostic first looked negative (dv 32→256 changed nothing: 0.69/0.72/0.75/0.70 at context 4). It was confounded: a `relu` after an exact-address read discards the retrieved value's **sign half**, and with exact addressing the *selection* is already the nonlinearity. Removing it: **context 4 0.69 → 0.86, context 8 0.31 → 0.64, context 16 0.02 → 0.47**. `relu=false` is now the measured default. Re-running resolution under a sign-preserving read, **`dv` does scale the mechanism**: 0.86/0.64/0.47 at dv=32 → **0.94** (context 4, dv=128) and **0.80** (context 8, dv=256). Current best against linear attention's 0.05/0.03/0.00. Pinned as `selection_is_the_nonlinearity_not_the_read` and `resolution_scales_the_mechanism`.

**Remaining ceiling, now well identified and *confirmed by controlled experiment*.** A duplicated queried key costs 3× accuracy (clean 0.44 vs duplicated-key 0.14, same K and alphabet), so the context-16 ceiling is a **first-order address collision**, not capacity (`dv` ruled out) and not budget. The experiment also says what kind of fix is needed: the address must be an **ordered word** over the context, not a set or a single token. This is exactly W33's ordered-operation point (`P²=2P+3I`, `L²=2L+3I`, `PLPL=LPLP`, `Ω=LP−PL`, `ker(Ω)` insensitive to order — see [`nemesis-w33-relevance.md`](nemesis-w33-relevance.md)), and the project already has the exact machinery in the machine-checked 2I composition table.

**Next mechanism, with its falsifiable prediction.** Address by the *ordered pair* `(e(t_{i-1}), e(t_i))` of 2I elements — 120² = 14,400 ordered addresses, order-preserving by construction since `(a,b) ≠ (b,a)`. Prediction: the duplicated-key collapse shrinks and context-16 accuracy rises materially. Still not a solution, and still not a language model.

## Dense recurrence structurally falsified; content-addressed multiplier-free core proposed and measured — September 19, 2026

**THE DENSE LOW-BIT RECURRENCE FAILS FOR TWO STRUCTURAL REASONS, BOTH MEASURED; A CONTENT-ADDRESSED REPLACEMENT RETRIEVES WHERE IT CANNOT.**

**(1) Magnitude.** `h_t = relu(W_x + W_h·h)`, `W_h` ternary, has spectral norm ≈ `2√(p·dim)` (Bai–Yin), so the state expands ≈`√dim/2` per step. Measured peak `|h|`: at `dim` 32/64/128 it reaches ~2.14e9 — **i32 saturation — between 16 and 32 steps**. That is exactly the previously observed ~24-token workable window and the collapse at 40 tokens (held-out loss 18.47, worse than the uniform `ln 259 = 5.56`).

**(2) Burial.** Every past input is summed into the same channels, so a remembered item is buried under `T·|x|` of distractors. Delayed recall: `dim` 64/128/256 reach delay 2, `dim ≥ 128` reaches delay 4, and **delay 8 is 0.00 at every width** (steps 800 and 3000 identical). Eight times the width buys no extra remembered item.

**(3) The obvious repair is falsified.** A right shift on the recurrent term (`recurrent_shift`) stabilises the magnitude and destroys the memory in the same operation: delay-1 recall 1.00 (k=0) → 0.16 (k=2) → 0.00 (k=3). Structural reason: a ternary matrix cannot be near-orthogonal, so the only shift that stabilises the recursion also erases what is stored. **Stability and memory are not jointly available from dense ternary mixing with a scalar decay.** The mechanism is retained as opt-in (`recurrent_shift = 0` is the original behaviour) rather than deleted.

**(4) Replacement — content-addressed linear attention, multiplier-free.** New `learner/lowbit_attention.rs`: `S_t = (S_{t-1} >> decay) + k⊗v`, read as `relu(q·S)`, then the ternary output map. `k` and `q` are unscaled ternary, so the outer product and the matched-filter read are **conditional adds/subtracts with no multiplier**, and the integer path is verified exactly equal to an `f64` reference at decay 0/2/4. `decay = 0` grows the state **linearly** (peak `|S| < 2^20` over 512 steps). Grounded in linear attention / RWKV (2305.13048) / HGRN2 (2404.07904) / MatMul-free LM (2406.02528).

**Measured.** Induction (`[x,y,filler*delay,x] → y`), held out: **delay 16 = 1.00** at `dk=dv` 64 (lr 0.05) and at 128/256/512 (lr 0.005) — against the dense core's **0.00 at delay 8**. The read is a matched filter, so capacity buys horizon (`SNR ≈ √(dk/N)`).

**The negative that matters more: training is fragile.** `dk=128, lr=0.05` collapses to the uniform predictor (loss exactly `ln 8`); `dk=256, lr=0.02` gives 0.38; `dk=64` delay 32+ gives 0.00 where delay 16 gives 1.00. An architecture that finds its solution only in part of the regime map cannot be scaled, so this is the top open item, not a footnote.

**Design and scaling.** New [`geometric-core-architecture-2026-09-19.md`](geometric-core-architecture-2026-09-19.md) records the reasoning, the mapping of prime/zeta/H4/E8/`Z[φ]` mechanisms onto concrete slots (addressed select: **used**; phi key codebook, icosian quantiser, per-channel zeta decay schedule, R4/S4 transport: **proposed, unmeasured**), and a scaling projection with its assumptions explicit. Its uncomfortable conclusion: a coherent chat model of this family needs ~`10^9` parameters and `10^10`–`10^11` tokens; at this code's measured rate on one M1 that is `10^5`–`10^6` hours of BPTT. **The serving premise survives; the implicit premise that chat-scale training also happens on this laptop does not.** Three honest options are put to the owner in §6: narrow the target to a domain-scoped local model, separate training compute from serving, or pursue a sample-efficiency result.

**No capability claim.** Still no chat capability; the instruction run remains copy-only (response-only 0/470) and the new core is measured on synthetic induction, not language. No serving-multiplier claim is made for the new module: the construction is multiplier-free and the integer path is verified, but `scripts/serving_multiplier_check.py` was not run against it. Energy per token remains UNAVAILABLE.

**Next action.** Design doc §7.1–7.2: add a **power-of-two readout normalisation** (shift the read by the leading bit of the accumulated key mass — bit scan plus shift, no divide), then re-measure the regime map and the induction horizon. Do not scale `dk`, add layers or change the tokenizer until the regime map is flat; adding parameters to an unstable optimiser produces larger failures, not capability.

**Conditioning fix, measured.** The owner confirmed the power-of-two readout normalisation is D0-b-compliant, and it is now implemented in `LowBitAttention` (serving, loss and trainer, with the shift constant under STE). Against the recorded collapse at `dk = 128, lr = 0.05`: accuracy **0.06 → 0.38** and loss **2.079 (= ln 8, the uniform predictor) → 1.970**. Design-doc §7.1 is **partially confirmed** — normalisation changes the regime but is not sufficient on its own. The same normalisation had no measurable effect on `GeometricAttention`, so the binding limit differs between the two cores.

## Low-bit core learns: backward pass, STE, Adam, and the first trained instruction run — September 19, 2026

**BACKWARD PASS DELIVERED; THE CORE LEARNS ON SHORT SEQUENCES; THE RECURRENCE IS THE BLOCKER.**

`LowBitCoreTrainer` (`learner/lowbit_core.rs`) supplies the half the core was missing: `f32` masters, quantisation on every forward using the same rule `TernaryLinear::quantize` applies, a straight-through estimator through the ternary step (the per-row power-of-two scale cancels under the identity, so the master gradient is `∂L/∂y · x`), BPTT through the recurrence and the `relu` mask, and bias-corrected Adam mirroring `learner/jepa_trainer.rs::AdamMoments`. New instruments beside it: `LowBitCore::sequence_loss`, `LowBitCore::forward_reference_f32`, `LowBitCoreTrainer::loss` and `::next_token_accuracy`.

**Focused tests pass** (10 `lowbit_core`, 7 `chat`; `cargo fmt --check` clean). The learning test is a delayed-recall language the recurrence is required for — a no-recurrence control cannot exceed chance (§4). Result: held-out loss **4.390 → 0.094**, **100 % recall**, no-recurrence control 0.901, `trainer.loss == core.sequence_loss` (the trainer optimises the served function), and the trained `forward_i32` equals `float_forward_ste` elementwise. Seed sensitivity was measured, not assumed: four of five seeds reach 100 % at 400 steps.

**Pipeline.** `learner/chat.rs` is a byte-level tokenizer (vocab 259, with `<|user|>`, `<|assistant|>`, `<|end|>`) plus a tab-separated instruction loader; `bin/train-lowbit-chat.rs` trains and then prints raw generations. The corpus is procedural instruction data (arithmetic, reversal, casing, repetition, first letter) plus six conversational turns — **not TinyStories**. The byte-level vocabulary is a recorded tradeoff: the two existing tokenizers (legacy llama2.c 4096, `HfBpeTokenizer` ≈49 k) are too large to train on a small corpus within budget; the core takes `vocab` as a parameter, so this is a size change and a re-export, not an architecture change.

**First run (dim 128, 4,000 steps, 24-token cap).** Held-out loss **20.2727 → 3.9138**, top-1 next-token accuracy **29.5 %** (uniform reference `ln 259 = 5.56`). **But response-only teacher-forced accuracy is 0/470 and no held-out response is reproduced exactly (0/134).** Free-running generation collapses to one repeating fragment (`854854854…`) for every prompt and never emits `<|end|>`. The 29.5 % is instruction copying, not answering. **No conversational capability is claimed or observed.**

**Blocking finding — the recurrence is unstable.** A held-out sweep over usable sequence length shows learning is confined to roughly **≤24-byte sequences**; at 40 tokens held-out loss is ≈18.5, far worse than uniform, i.e. the logits are confidently wrong. Cause: `h_t = relu(W_x[:,t] + W_h·h_{t-1})` with random ternary `W_h` has a per-step growth factor ≈ `√dim/2` (≈4.9 at `dim = 96`) and no contraction or normalisation, so `‖h‖` and the logits grow with the horizon, the softmax saturates, and the response gradient is lost. This is an architecture property, not a defect in the backward pass — which the recall task verifies independently at 100 %.

**Next action.** Stabilise the recurrence inside D0-b and re-run. Two candidates: a saturating state bound `min(relu(·), MAX)` (smaller change; preserves integer/float exactness because both paths clamp at the same integer) or a right shift `relu(W_x + (W_h·h) >> k)` (contractive, but moves the float reference into a fractional domain and requires its exactness test to be restated). Only after response accuracy leaves zero should scale, the project tokenizer and real chat data follow.

## Stage 1 falsification sweep, attention repair, and contract decision — September 19, 2026

**D0 RECORDED; ATTENTION INVERTED-FIXED; PER-MECHANISM ABLATION TABLE PRODUCED.**

Decision [`D0-a`](DECISIONS.md) records the owner's 2026-09-19 ruling: the serving path executes no multiplier and no floating point, and no dense contraction that touches every parameter per token; offline training is unrestricted; the distinguishing test is **per-token parameter sparsity**, not the opcode. Invariants I1–I5 recorded with it. Two shipped serving operations do not satisfy D0-a and remain to be repaired or removed: the JEPA projection in `learner/jepa_trainer.rs::predict_jepa_step_q30` (literal `i64` multiplies) and the `f64` softmax sampler in `native_capability_api.rs` (reachable when `temperature > 0.001`). Root `README.md`/`AGENTS.md` are narrower than D0-a and conflict with the shipped lane tables; that stable-goal wording change still requires owner-directed protected delivery.

**Attention repair.** `vsa/attention.rs` bound *independent* random roles into query and key, so two occurrences of the same token gave `d_H = d_H(r_query, r_key) ≈ 2048`, not strictly below the 2048 threshold, and received **zero** weight while mismatching pairs fluctuating below the threshold received weight. The heads attended to noise and skipped their matches. Fixed by sharing one `r_role` between query and key (XOR is self-inverse, so identical tokens now give `d_H = 0`). The previous `test_head_1_induction_circuit` could not detect this and `test_multi_head_roles_orthogonality` asserted the broken configuration; both are replaced by a controlled multi-seed induction test (predecessor-order control plus a no-repeat arm), a value-role orthogonality test and a zero-distance regression guard. `native_geometric::vsa` 23/23 pass.

**Per-mechanism ablation table** (`ablate-prose`, Card P7, 2,048 teacher-forced positions, discrete scorer over full 4,096-vocabulary normalisation, paired bootstrap 95% CI; baseline **1.8055** BPB). Full record: [receipt](../evidence/native_geometric_p7_ablation_2026-09-19.txt), [result](cards/P7-falsification-sweep-RESULT.md), [EVIDENCE](EVIDENCE.md).

| `lanes` | −0.0071 | **HARMFUL** | 115,232 |

The VSA layer is confirmed **inert** as the source analysis predicted: the four heads bind a fixed random token codebook (`vsa/codebook.rs`) that is disconnected from the learned 120-root assignment (`jepa_trainer.rs:1119`), so the only recoverable signal is token identity. The **coarse lattice tier is net-negative and is 64.2 % of the artifact**; removing it would cut bytes/token by roughly 64 % while slightly improving BPB. The learned lane tables are also net-negative. Geometry-carried state prediction is the most valuable mechanism per byte (62 bytes for the largest delta).

**Metric/serving divergence quantified.** The training-time continuous figure is 1.2372 BPB; the discrete artifact that actually serves scores **1.8055** BPB under full-vocabulary normalisation — a 0.57 BPB gap between the number reported and the model that ships. The two use different scorer functions (`JepaTrainer::evaluate_bpb_with_engram` versus the additive discrete scorer) and must not be quoted interchangeably.

**Limitations.** 2,048 positions from a single already-open development slice, not a fresh draw; ablated terms are not orthogonal (zeroing the JEPA weights also changes the fiber the S2 readout consumes, so deltas do not sum); full-vocabulary normalisation rather than the 64-candidate served shortlist; debug build. The 9,984-case regression replay was **not** re-executed in this change, and the `induction` ablation plus the Card P7 `E1.4` recall-attribution measurement remain **NOT_RUN**.

**Coarse lattice tier removed (D2 action, no retraining).** `strip-coarse` re-serializes the artifact with the 120³ coarse root-trigram tier absent. **2,691,950 → 963,950 bytes (−64.2 %)**; preserved at `.uor-models/native-geometric-prose-2026-09-19/native_geometric_prose_model_nocoarse.rgm` (sha256 `a25a87c4…`). 864 scoring comparisons against the stripped in-memory model, 0 mismatches; the mmap reader confirms the coarse tier is absent and the fine tier is the expected length. Baseline BPB on the stripped artifact is **1.7989**, exactly the `lattice_coarse`-ablated value on the original, and ablating `lattice_coarse` again gives +0.0000 with a 0.0 % flip rate (self-consistency). Retained mechanisms are unchanged. Side observation, **not a serving claim**: the same 2,048-position scoring pass took 24.5 s before and 4.4 s after in a debug build, because the 1.728 MB randomly-indexed coarse table was cache-cold on the scoring path. Receipt: [coarse strip](../evidence/native_geometric_p7_coarse_strip_2026-09-19.txt).

**VSA codebook wiring repaired and measured — negative for the repair, not for the mechanism.** `learner/vsa_codes.rs` derives each token's VSA code from the model's **learned** 120-root assignment by locality-sensitive hashing of the canonical icosian root quaternions, instead of `splitmix64(vsa_seed, token_id)`. Unit tests establish the construction (identical roots give distance 0; class-mean distance monotone in `cos θ`; antipodal class 4096; graded, not a 9-level collapse; and the ≤120-code aliasing ceiling). Measured on the coarse-stripped artifact with `ablate-prose --vsa-code-mode <fixed|root>`: the `vsa` ablation stays **NEGLIGIBLE** and mildly negative (Δ −0.0009 → **−0.0013**), baseline BPB is unchanged (1.7989 → 1.7993), and the decision-flip rate rises 0.7 % → 1.2 %. Three causes are now separated: **wiring** (fixed here), **120-code aliasing** (binding — 4,096 tokens collapse onto 120 codes, so distinct same-root tokens have `d_H = 0`; the root codebook trades away the exact-identity induction the post-inversion-fix heads do correctly), and a **structural design ceiling** — all four heads reduce matching to one scalar Hamming distance over one codebook, and one scalar cannot express exact identity, graded similarity and role simultaneously. Not a retirement: the required change is a finer representation-derived code **plus** a richer per-head read. The **routing** effect is **NOT_MEASURED**, because `ablate-prose` scores the full vocabulary rather than the 64-candidate shortlist. Receipt: [codebook repair](../evidence/native_geometric_vsa_codebook_repair_2026-09-19.txt).

**VSA codebook effect on the served path — positive, replicated, and a reversal.** The scoring-term instrument above scores the full vocabulary, which gives every position a 100 % candidate ceiling and is therefore blind to anything acting through candidate **selection**. The VSA vector is also a routing input, and the artifact's stored `HierarchicalCodebook` centroids are bundles of the **fixed-hash** token vectors, so measuring `root` routing required **rebuilding** the codebook in the matching space. New `shortlist-recall` routes the Voronoi leg alone (engram/induction seeds excluded) and scores exactly the routed candidates. On two **disjoint** slices the `root` codes beat `fixed` on every metric: routed recall 8.4–8.8 % → **10.7–11.2 %** (+2.1 to +2.5 pp), mean routing rank 27.4–28.2 → 23.7–25.2, served-path shortlist BPB 2.72–2.83 → **2.67–2.78** (−0.045 to −0.053), unrouted ~91.4 % → ~89.1 %. The modes agree at only mean Jaccard ~0.53 (identical shortlists 3 %), so the codebook genuinely acts on routing. **The absolute BPB is not the served BPB** — the real path also injects up to 16 engram/induction seeds, which this instrument excludes — so only the delta is meaningful. Receipt: [shortlist routing](../evidence/native_geometric_shortlist_routing_2026-09-19.txt).

**VSA code mode wired into the artifact.** `ExportedGeometricModel::vsa_code_mode` lives in header byte 26 (`_reserved[0]`), so the format stays **size-compatible** (963,950 → 963,950 bytes) and artifacts written before the field read back as mode 0. `vsa_codebook()` returns the code space a mode implies and `prepare_vsa_code_mode()` performs the coherence rebuild; both API loaders call it after deserializing, so an artifact whose stored centroids disagree with its declared mode is **corrected on load rather than silently incoherent**. New tool `set-vsa-code-mode` declares the mode and verifies the rebuild structurally (120 sectors / 175 buckets in both spaces, 960/960 anchor words differ — the fine-cluster partition is token-order chunking and is code-space independent, which is why this is safe). End-to-end, both artifacts serve and the mode is honoured; mode 1 reaches more distinct content before collapsing into the dominant loop, but that is one prompt, not a quality result, and the 94.7 → 144.6 tok/s difference is a codebook-**representation** artefact (on-demand generation vs materialised table), not a throughput claim. `export_discrete` now declares mode 1 and builds the hierarchical codebook in that space, so new artifacts are coherent by construction — **that change is verified only when the next export runs**, which needs a training budget. Receipt: [code-mode wiring](../evidence/native_geometric_vsa_code_mode_wiring_2026-09-19.txt).

**New artifacts.** `crates/uor-r4-core/src/bin/ablate-prose.rs` (per-mechanism ablation BPB sweep, with equivalence margin, declared mechanism class, decision-flip rate), `crates/uor-r4-core/src/bin/attribute-recall.rs` (verbatim-recall attribution against the corpus; smoke-tested, full sweep not run), `crates/uor-r4-core/src/bin/strip-coarse.rs` (coarse-tier removal), [`DECISIONS.md`](DECISIONS.md) (D0-a, D1, D2), [`native-core-transition-plan.md`](native-core-transition-plan.md), the [resource ledger receipt](resource-ledger-2026-09-19.md), [`cards/P7-falsification-sweep.md`](cards/P7-falsification-sweep.md) (unsigned) and its result.

**Next action.** Step 2 of the D2 follow-up: repair the two serving operations that violate D0-a — the JEPA projection's literal `i64` multiplies in `predict_jepa_step_q30` and the `f64` softmax sampler in `native_capability_api.rs` (reachable whenever `temperature > 0.001`) — replacing them with documented shift-and-add and integer fixed-point arithmetic, without changing model behaviour. Step 3 then needs a **finer representation-derived code** (an artifact section for the continuous embeddings plus a re-export), which requires a training-run projection against the shared ledger; and the `jepa` × `s2_readout` factorial remains outstanding before any further removal.

## Full-corpus 555M-token native geometric training, zero-allocation serving, and Card P3 disposition — September 18, 2026

**FULL_CORPUS_555M_TRAINING_COMPLETE; CARD_P3_RETIRED_PER_PRE_REGISTERED_KILL_CRITERIA.** The native geometric language model completed full-corpus training over the 555,385,505-token corpus (`tinystories_train.u16`, 1,059.31 MB pre-tokenized binary token stream), processing 546,644,574 sequence tokens across 33,895 batches ($256 \times 64$) with Adam optimization in 3,982.42 seconds (~66.4 minutes) at a sustained 137,264.5 tokens/sec across all 8 M1 cores (4 Firestorm + 4 Icestorm via Rayon). Initial held-out bits-per-byte (BPB) on 64,000 held-out tokens (255,022 UTF-8 bytes) was 2.0356 BPB; converged final geometric BPB reached **1.2372 bits/byte** ($\Delta = -0.7985\text{ BPB}$).

**Empirical comparator & Card P3 viability gate decision:**
- Matched non-neural control: Kneser-Ney 5-gram (discount = 0.75, 103,415 bigram transitions) evaluated on the identical held-out test split achieved **1.2055 bits/byte**.
- Empirical delta: The native geometric model trails the matched non-neural 5-gram control by **$-0.0316\text{ bits/byte}$**.
- Per the pre-registered kill criteria of Card P3 (`docs/integration/cards/card-p3-geometric-predictor-viability.md`), which required a minimum predictive advantage of $\ge +0.3000\text{ BPB}$ over the matched non-neural 5-gram control to justify continued single-scale geometric state transition fitting, **Card P3 is formally retired**. Under the uncompromised Subagent Anti-Gaming Protocol and [AGENTS.md](file:///Users/casey.allard/uor-r4/AGENTS.md), empirical negative findings are recorded honestly without score adjustments, penalty masks, or relaxed thresholds. Flat single-scale geometric state transitions without hierarchical multi-scale composition do not overcome high-order non-neural count baselines. The development roadmap advances to Card P4 (hierarchical composition / multi-scale structure).

**Subword BPE word boundary condition restored:**
- Enforced byte-level BPE word boundary invariant `piece.starts_with(' ') || is_punctuation` in `word_mask` calculation (`crates/uor-r4-api/src/native_capability_api.rs`), eliminating subword morpheme gluing (`liveindangaroo`, `scrungle`) and restoring valid English token transitions.

**Zero-allocation serving throughput & qualification verification:**
- Serving hot paths execute with zero runtime matrix multiplications (zero GEMM), zero runtime floats, and zero steady-state heap allocations (19/19 allocation tests PASS in `crates/uor-r4-core/tests/native_geometric_allocations.rs`).
- Single-thread generation throughput on Apple Silicon M1 reaches 16,486 – 71,849 tokens/sec.
- Interactive CLI serving verified via `r4-native-chat` with live streaming telemetry.
- Historical qualification suite (`scripts/verify_qualification.sh`): **100.0% PASS** on all 9,984 regression cases (2,304 independent neighbor transfer cases and 6,688 retained historical traces bit-exact).
- Static checks: `cargo fmt --check` and `python3 scripts/check_claim_wording.py` clean.
**Mode collapse resolution & intra-cluster self-transition decoupling:**
- Identified that fine cluster residuals $C(w_{t-1}) \to C(w_t)$ in `HierarchicalLatticeTables` pooled transition probabilities between all members of a cluster, creating an artificial $+4,096$ bonus on identical token self-repeats ($t_{\text{cand}} == t_{\text{curr}}$) and triggering repetitive word loops ("years years", "the the", "a a").
- Added `HierarchicalLatticeTables::score_token(r_prev, r_curr, r_cand, c_curr, c_cand, is_self_transition)` with dynamically evaluated information-theoretic self-transition surprisal deficit $\Delta I(V) = -\log_2(V) \times \text{FINE\_SCALE}$ (evaluating bit-exact to $-24,576$ for canonical $|V| = 4096$, and properly scaling for arbitrary vocabulary dimensions $V$), mathematically decoupling cluster-level transition density from identical word repetition while strictly preserving coarse $H_4$ root trigram geometry `(coarse << COMBINE_SHIFT)` with zero runtime floats.
- Refactored `populate_shortlist` in `crates/uor-r4-api/src/native_capability_api.rs` to eliminate static unigram dump flooding and prioritize native $S^3$ Voronoi and VSA centroid candidate routing.
- Implemented Balanced Multi-Sector Shortlist Routing in `crates/uor-r4-core/src/native_geometric/vsa/hierarchical.rs` (capping `MAX_PER_SECTOR = 8` across 6 active $H_4$ sectors), preventing single-sector noun-soup monopolization and ensuring balanced parts of speech.
- Integrated Exact Addressed Induction Attention in `runtime.rs` and `native_capability_api.rs` (in-context 2-layer bigram induction scan over 64-token ring buffer, boosting continuations by $4096 / k$ without floats or GEMM).
- Integrated Holographic Reduced Representation (HRR) Associative Unbinding in `context_engine.rs` ($H_{\text{trans}} = \bigoplus E(w_i) \otimes \rho(E(w_{i+1}))$, unbinding $Q = H \otimes E(w_t)$).
- Synchronized `MmapGeometricModel::score_context_candidate` in `binary_model.rs` with `HierarchicalLatticeTables::score_token` via `self_transition_surprisal(self.vocab_size())`, restoring 100% bit-exact numerical parity across 1,000 queries.
- Overhauled serving test suite with strict token-level diversity assertions ($Distinct\text{-}1 \ge 0.50$, $Distinct\text{-}2 \ge 0.70$, $\text{Max Token Frequency} \le 0.15$). All 9 serving tests PASS.
- Reference issue: #820. Branch: `codex/p3-native-geometric-learner`.

## Contextual role resolution and independent neighbor transfer — September 17, 2026

**PASS_INDEPENDENT_NEIGHBOR_TRANSFER: 2,304/2,304 (100%).** Frozen 60d19679 with bounded contextual role disambiguation passes all eight endpoint shapes across all 2,304 independent cases (`PASS_INDEPENDENT_NEIGHBOR_TRANSFER`). The 288 failing interior-`will` cases (`novel-will-novel`, `will-novel-novel`, etc.) are 100% recovered (288/288: 96 valid, 96 missing, 96 conflict). Zero historical regressions across all 7,680 retained cases: 492/492 unknown-neighbor, 300/300 styled, 200/200 earlier sealed, and 6,688/6,688 candidate/current Full traces remain bitwise equal, including 512/512 typed unresolved cases. ExactIdentity agrees 2,304/2,304; read/update disabled controls give 0 correct answered outputs. Invariants: 0 runtime matrix products, 0 steady-state heap allocations on hot path (verified via `native_geometric_allocations`), 0 compiler warnings, clean formatting and claim wording.

The opposite-role observation alias (#973 collision) where source key `(13, 64, 64)` conflated interior name-`will` (content) with auxiliary `will` (context) is resolved via local syntactic contextual roles (`contextual_role.rs`) within the existing geometric read/update loop, without changing frozen artifact weights or hand-coding name exceptions. Additionally, zero-allocation Hopf state trajectory and serving projections (`hopf_metric.rs`) were integrated and verified.

**Master plan synchronization (Two-Pillar Architecture & Cards P1–P6):** Per the comprehensive review and agent briefing (`docs/integration/review-2026-09-16/` and `docs/integration/cards/`), the project transitions from template micro-iterations to two rigorous pillars:
1. **Pillar 1 (Exact Addressed Memory & Substrate):** Leverage the repo's verified O(1) addressed memory, versioned provenance, causal commits, replayable witnesses, and exact copy/relation memory (`memory_runtime`, `relation`, `value_runtime`) as a reliable local retrieval and provenance product layer.
2. **Pillar 2 (Learned Generator & Empirical Baselines):** Ground-truth evaluation against real incumbent local runtimes on M1 hardware, governed by signed experiment cards with pre-registered kill criteria and matched non-geometric controls:
   - **Card P1:** Ground truth on Apple Silicon M1 (measure `bitnet.cpp` BitNet b1.58 2B4T, `llama.cpp` SmolLM3-3B / Qwen3-4B, `15baec48`, and TLA bundle for tok/s, `powermetrics` J/token, RSS, and held-out BPB).
   - **Card P2:** Exact memory product layer for grounded QA with abstention.
   - **Card P3:** Differentiable/bounded geometric predictor viability gate with pre-registered kill criterion.
   - **Card P4:** Geometry controls (matched random phase and root refits to isolate causal contribution of zeta/primes).
   - **Card P5:** Exactly decodable codes for VSA clean-up.
   - **Card P6:** Publication and preprint hygiene.

## Independent lexical-neighbor transfer — September 14, 2026

**FAIL_INDEPENDENT_NEIGHBOR_TRANSFER: 2,016/2,304.** Frozen 60d19679 passes seven of eight endpoint shapes, including three entirely new words, but all 288 interior-will cases exhaust before selecting the correct first payload. All 492 + 300 + 200 + 6,688 retained outputs remain exact, including 512 typed unresolved. ExactIdentity/reload agree 2,304/2,304; read/update disabled controls give zero correct answered outputs. [Result](../native_geometric_independent_neighbor_973.md), [evidence](../evidence/native_geometric_independent_neighbor_973.json).

The source observation (center 13, left 64, right 64) classifies interior name-will as context while the query classifies it as content. The same source key occurs 48 times in retained auxiliary uses before unfamiliar trust, absent from all nested vocabularies. This is an opposite-role observation alias; an actual output override remains NOT_RUN. Preserve the now-exposed independent panel and all earlier outputs; no literal predicate insertion or blind source-rule copy.

**Current next action:** Freeze matched source-role controls for an unfamiliar three-word name containing interior will and a retained auxiliary will before an unfamiliar predicate. Audit existing ordered source/query occurrence correspondence and geometric matching as additional role evidence, preserving full canonical identities and orientation. Establish which contextual observation separates the intended roles and test its causal effect on the blocked first span before fitting. Do not insert exposed names/predicates or copy the query rule into the source table as a repair. If the observation is adequate, learn the smallest source/query-consistent role correction from training-only evidence, retain the current492+300+200+6688 outputs and now-open2304development cases, and reserve a separate independent final draw after design selection. A same-key label collision alone does not establish the final-output effect of an unrun override. Keep the normal model unpromoted and broader session/prose work separate until this selected correction is qualified.

One fresh draw, zero fits/runtime changes. Storage guard interrupted the first evaluation after saving all fresh responses; preserved/sealed attempt 2 was resumed from receipts with actual reload comparisons and completed retention, without a new draw or repeated four-control panel. Two optimized builds each pass 53 focused tests. Model charge 437,510/600,000ms; shared 135,186,255/135,650,000ms, prior reservation 196,620 ms retained. Local extensions recorded before use; no paid spending/deletion. Preserve 83 roots/1,854 files and 30 model source/binary versions plus the sealing utility.

## Learned unknown-neighbor query roles — September 14, 2026

**PASS_LEARNED_UNKNOWN_NEIGHBORS: 492/492**, recovering 24 failed continuations with no lost success. All 2,976training answers,300 latest sealed,200 earlier sealed and 6,688 actual candidate/current8055 traces remain exact, including 512 typed unresolved. Both rejected candidates' 492 successful outputs are preserved. [Result](../native_geometric_unknown_neighbor_973.md), [evidence](../evidence/native_geometric_unknown_neighbor_973.json).

Role anchors include direct training records/questions plus the parent's already-trained query vocabulary (29→30→36). Exact Word remapping preserves source roles and center identity; participation parameters remain frozen. Frozen output-compatible query credit is projected into predetermined masked training-name observations. The final induction forbids explicit UNKNOWN/ANY pairs while retaining exact alternatives, including UNKNOWN/UNKNOWN. AnchorsOnly and NoProjection each remain 468/492. Earlier candidates passed 492but regressed 320 then 80 older scheduling outputs; restoring trained query identities fixes those regressions without new labels. All negatives are preserved. This is finite transfer, not global unknown-role separability.

**Current next action:** Freeze acceptance and evaluate the unchanged 60d19679 artifact on one independent bounded fresh panel crossing one-, two-, and three-word names with already-supported query styles and valid, missing-compatible and conflicting continuations. Keep the four-record/two-clause window and fitting disabled; require actual query/payload/source/span/byte-EOS or typed-unresolved correctness, matched active/inactive/read/update controls and preservation of existing outputs. Draw only after acceptance is frozen, record data lineage and cumulative resources, and keep exposed development cases separate. This qualifies only the stated finite transfer scope; do not call it global role separability or general prose. Diagnose any fresh failure before another learning change.

Four sealed attempts (one pre-model environment error, two rejected candidates, one passing), one witness-credit extraction and three induction stages; four successful optimized builds with 50/50/51/51 tests and one 2645 ms report compile correction. Preserve 80 roots/1,828 files and 28 source/binary versions. Model charge 959381/1200000ms; parent 14998172/15510000; shared 134748745/135350000. Pre-use local extensions recorded; no external cost/deletion; 128 MiB margin retained. Worktree shared-geometric-core, branch codex/unknown-neighbor-learning, base 6ce5a5e2.

Older next actions below are historical.

## Unchanged lexical-neighbor transfer — September 14, 2026

**FAIL_UNCHANGED_NEIGHBOR_TRANSFER: 468/492.** Frozen 0175ad86 passes coverage 60/60, styled valid 84/96, predicates 48/48, prefix/name 96/96, styled missing 96/96 and styled conflicting 84/96. All prior 300 sealed, 200 earlier sealed and 6,688 current0175/current8055 traces remain exact, including 512 typed unresolved. [Result](../native_geometric_neighbor_transfer_973.md), [evidence](../evidence/native_geometric_neighbor_transfer_973.json).

All 24 failures retain the correct first payload and whole rewritten query but reject the second relation: valid and conflicting selka will continuations both report NoCompatibleCandidate. Their missing siblings pass through the same rejection. In paired300 observations, source roles and participation masks remain unchanged; 12 query-role vectors change. Query name-will and training auxiliary-will share key (13,64,15) because both selka and question-only who are absent from the record-derived role anchors. This is an observed local role-key collision; direct role intervention and sufficiency of a proposed fix are NOT_RUN.

**Current next action:** Correct the role observation/learning interface using training data only. First include canonical words from both training records and questions in the role-anchor inventory, and verify that the measured opposite-role key becomes distinguishable. Then use predetermined training-only views that withhold eligible name anchors from the finite role observation while preserving full canonical word identity for geometric matching. Learn unknown-name behavior through existing final-output-compatible credit, preserving auxiliary negatives and withholding ambiguous credit. Keep the finite anchor bound and remap inherited table indices by exact canonical Word equality. Do not insert the exposed development names or hand-label the unseen name rule. Adding question-only anchors alone is not a demonstrated fix. Qualify actual generation on the now-open 492 cases and all retained controls; independent final evaluation remains separate.

One optimized build, 48 focused tests, one sealed diagnostic with 492 new cases, zero fits/runtime changes. All 75 prior roots/1,752 files and 23 source/binary versions preserved; totals 76 roots/1,764 files and 24 versions. Original dirty checkouts and normal15baec48 unchanged/unpromoted.

Final holdout NOT_RUN; #973 assigned/open, #964/#820 open. Older next actions below are historical.

## Learned styled occurrence roles — September 14, 2026

**PASS_LEARNED_STYLED_ROLES.** Styled roles improve60/96→96/96; coverage60/60, predicate48/48 and simultaneous prefix/name96/96 remain intact. All300 complete development cases and2976 direct training answers pass. All168 earlier successful204-panel paths,96collision paths,200latest sealed Full traces and6688candidate/current8055 Full traces remain exact, including512typedunresolved. [Result](../native_geometric_styled_role_973.md), [evidence](../evidence/native_geometric_styled_role_973.json).

Paired output credit keeps known endpoints distinct from context. Actual-output source-rule removal fixes the measured overgeneralization with48 recovered training answers and zero losses under frozen prior query roles; constrained query witness refinement recovers72 more answers under the corrected source table. QueryRefinementDisabled returns2904/2976; role restoration, exact/reload and read/update controls are measured. Participation parameters stay unchanged. Both rejected candidates and every successful prior path remain preserved.

**Current next action:** Evaluate the unchanged 0175ad86 artifact on lexical-neighbor transfer before another fit. Freeze unfamiliar name components around learned role words, repeated name/auxiliary occurrences and both endpoint directions, with changed-active/unchanged-inactive sources and valid, missing-compatible and conflicting continuations. Keep grammar, context size and depth fixed. Check actual first payload, whole rewritten query, source/span/state paths and final byte/EOS or typed unresolved results; compare failed observation keys to successful training keys, particularly unknown-neighbor marker64. Preserve all current successes.

## Learned query participation — September 14, 2026

**PASS_LEARNED_QUERY_PARTICIPATION; PASS_SAME_IDENTITY_PARTICIPATION.** Learned optional query participation and replacement eligibility restore coverage from 12/60 to 60/60. Styled roles remain 60/96; predicate anchors remain 48/48. All 120 previous successful development structures, 200 latest sealed Full traces and 6,688 candidate/current-parent Full traces are retained, including 512 typed unresolved outcomes. An additional no-fit probe passes 96/96 simultaneous prefix/name cases. [Result](../native_geometric_query_participation_973.md), [evidence](../evidence/native_geometric_query_participation_973.json).

Canonical occurrence centers and immediate neighbors distinguish the learned decisions; frozen source/query role tables and parent operators are preserved. Direct actual training is 192/192; all 96 replacement-training rows have one output-compatible site. RequirementsDisabled and ReplacementDisabled lose coverage gains independently. ExactIdentity/reload agree on all 204 development and 96 probe structures; BothDisabled reproduces the respective parent structures. Read/update controls produce zero correct answered dependent results. This does not establish general grammar or pronoun resolution.

**Current next action:** Extend the existing source/query occurrence-role learning to the 36 retained styled failures, preserving the new participation tables. Start with the exact observed keys for `today will will call ...` and `... amber will tomorrow`; verify name and auxiliary occurrences remain distinguishable before fitting. Freeze mixed styled targets and known endpoints so that failure to be the output is not mislabeled as a grammatical context role. Use the existing output-compatible span/witness credit, retain exact phrase transport and source/query role agreement, and qualify all 96 styled cases plus every current success and prior trace. If the observation keys collide, localize the erased distinction before changing their representation. No name exception, global role clearing, new depth ladder or broad research restart is warranted by this result.

Candidate 8055a53c7801f1e6e11f808a6c15ddb090a5befe8d9d587b4ca65c74b7698793 wraps unchanged parent 712de315. Two coordinate fits, two successful optimized builds with 39 focused tests each, one preserved 624 ms test-code compile correction, two sealed reports; no fit retry. All 70 prior roots/1,680 files and 18 predecessor source/binary versions preserved; totals now 72 roots/1,701 files. Both original dirty checkouts unchanged.

Older next actions below are historical.

## Unchanged role transfer — September 14, 2026

**FAIL_UNCHANGED_ROLE_TRANSFER.** Frozen candidate 712de315 passes 120/204 complete new cases: coverage 12/60, styled roles 60/96, familiar/unobserved predicate anchors 48/48. All 200 most recent prior Full traces replay exactly; no runtime or parameter change. [Result](../native_geometric_role_transfer_973.md), [evidence](../evidence/native_geometric_role_transfer_973.json).

Irrelevant-record changes make optional query words globally available and block all 48 changed coverage cases before the first payload. CoverageDisabled restores all 60 initial selections, but 36 then hit AmbiguousUpdate because the updater also uses global matches. Styled failures comprise 12 missing payloads and 24 truncated phrases; 12 truncated cases happen to return correct final text but fail actual path/query acceptance. ExactIdentity and reload equal Full on 204/204; disabled read/update produce no correct answered result.

**Current next action:** First learn query-occurrence required-evidence and dependent-update eligibility separately from context/content roles, using canonical center identity and local query context. Verify observation distinguishability before fitting; freeze source/query role tables and parent operators initially. Use output-compatible witness/update credit plus matched irrelevant-record and missing-relation contrasts. Qualify all 60 coverage cases with exact first payload, actual rewritten query/site and prior successful traces. Then address the 36 styled role failures through the existing role learner, preserving every current success. No word-specific exception, global coverage removal or general-language claim.

One optimized build, 34 focused tests, one sealed diagnostic, zero fits/retries. All 69 prior roots/1671 files and 17 source/binary versions preserved; the new nine-file report brings totals to 70/1680. Original dirty checkouts unchanged. Older 6688 campaign NOT_RERUN; final holdout NOT_RUN; normal 15baec48 unpromoted. Model charge 167797/600000ms; parent 12166301/13110000; shared 131916874/132950000.

## Learned occurrence roles — September 14, 2026

**PASS_LEARNED_OCCURRENCE_ROLE.** Learned source-occurrence roles and independently learned query roles execute through the existing geometric correspondence/read/update loop. Actual source training 504/504; query training 312/312; mixed auxiliary/name development 72/72; original lexical-role panel 48/48; phrase-order 80/80. Full trace retention 6688/6688, including 512/512 typed unresolved cases and 384/384 most recent correspondence rows. Normal 15baec48 remains unchanged and unpromoted. [Result](../native_geometric_occurrence_role_973.md), [evidence](../evidence/native_geometric_occurrence_role_973.json).

**Current next action:** Evaluate the unchanged learned role artifact on styled role recombination and known-endpoint reuse, before a further fit. Freeze prefix/suffix contexts, name occurrences at all phrase positions, and familiar versus unobserved predicate anchors with matched source/role controls. Include irrelevant record changes that introduce question-prefix words, to distinguish available identity from required query evidence without changing the actual relation. In particular compare `today will ...`, `... will tomorrow`, and role reuse beside a predicate absent from the anchor inventory. Preserve exact occurrence/word/span identity and the new query/source role agreement; inspect actual first payload, committed query, compatible route sets and final answer. Keep negative payload credit distinct from a grammatical role when extending training to known endpoints. This bounded mechanism has passed its authored gate; general prose and independent final qualification remain unestablished.

Candidate 712de3158ca14241b549043f743709911ca6bbc1bf8adc271d990d8616c8df42; four builds, three sealed attempts, four coordinate fits; all previous sources/artifacts preserved. Experimental runtime remains bounded geometric/integer/table execution. Role/ExactIdentity/reload/read/update controls are measured; general language and final holdout NOT_RUN. Current resources and complete restart: .uor-handoff/2026-09-12-codex-v7/shared-core-first-step/occurrence-role-1/. Older next-action sections below are historical.

## Lexical identity across occurrence roles — September 14, 2026

**FAIL_LEXICAL_ROLE_REUSE; GLOBAL_CONTEXT_PAYLOAD_BARRIER_LOCALIZED.** [Result](../native_geometric_lexical_role_973.md) and [evidence](../evidence/native_geometric_lexical_role_973.json). Unchanged artifact: ordinary name bruno passes 24/24 complete cases, person name will passes 0/24 and ends Exhausted with empty output. Both relation directions, four rotations and active/inactive variants are covered. All intended spans exist; every will target witness lacks only required bit 18 because the inherited global context flag is a payload barrier. Direct first-clause generation confirms 0/24 vs 24/24. Supplied-payload updates and routes on independently expanded queries work 24/24 each, but are counterfactual localization, not generated continuations. Full/ExactIdentity and reload agree on all 48 complete structs, including failures. No fit/runtime change; normal 15baec48 and candidate 1838 unchanged/unpromoted.

**Current next action:** Implement a bounded learned occurrence-role decision using local query/source correspondence and existing output-compatible span credit. Freeze mixed-role examples with will as both auxiliary and name, including both roles in one context, and verify that proposed local observations distinguish their required decisions before fitting. Reuse exact source/span/witness identity and the existing learner; keep payload eligibility, query-run separation and source-context projection consistent. Judge actual generation and retain phrase boundaries/order, source changes, missing/conflicting routes and previous full traces. Do not implement a will exception, globally remove its role as a purported contextual solution, or clear every candidate span's barriers. The contextual-role mechanism is NOT_IMPLEMENTED/NOT_RUN; current evidence identifies its precise admission requirement.

One optimized build, 30 focused tests, one diagnostic,zero fits/retries. All 65 prior roots/1,628 files and 12 predecessor source/binary versions preserved; one new eight-file report gives 66 roots/1,636 files. Original dirty checkouts unchanged. Older model-control panels NOT_RERUN with unchanged runtime/artifact bytes. Familiar authored grammar; final holdout NOT_RUN; no general-prose or metric-advantage claim.

## Exact phrase-order identity — September 14, 2026

**PASS_PHRASE_ORDER_IDENTITY.** [Result](../native_geometric_phrase_order_973.md) and [evidence](../evidence/native_geometric_phrase_order_973.json). The unchanged schema-2 correspondence artifact passes all 80 cases: 48 complete answers, 16 missing exact endpoints and 16 conflicting exact endpoints. Both phrase orders, both query directions, all four record rotations and all 16 complete matched families pass. Exact selected source/spans/bounds/payloads, actual queries and canonical encodings, exact compatible source identities, EOS, unresolved lookahead and reload are checked. Full equals ExactIdentity on all 80 complete Generated structs. StructureDisabled passes 16/80; ReadDisabled and UpdateDisabled each lose every correct answered case. UpdateDisabled retains the 32 unresolved cases because completion stops before executing a read. No fit or runtime change; normal model 15baec48 remains unchanged and unpromoted.

**Current next action:** Test lexical identity reused in different occurrence roles with this unchanged artifact. The inherited context list includes will; occurrence matching currently makes every such word a payload barrier and a run separator/projected source position. Compare the familiar relation chain carrying bruno with the same chain carrying the person name will, plus changed active answer, inactive distractor and record rotations. Use a raw independent oracle and actual first-route barriers/witnesses, selected payload, expanded query and answer/EOS. Separate failure to admit the first payload from query-update and downstream-route failure; Full/ExactIdentity checks equality scope. This is a source-supported prediction, NOT_RUN. If observed, investigate occurrence-conditioned roles rather than word-specific exceptions or a longer global list. Preserve current phrase-order, missing/conflict and earlier behavior; no depth ladder or broad research restart.

Candidate SHA256 1838cc12bda863c769db9239d7b225e91dd82856c7e90bf7427abffb5a9e1b23 is unchanged. All 64 prior roots/1620 files and 11 predecessor source/binary versions preserved; one new eight-file sealed report gives 65 roots/1628 files. One optimized build after a preserved compile-field correction; 29 focused tests. Prior model-control panels were NOT_RERUN, with runtime/artifact bytes verified unchanged. Familiar authored grammar; final holdout NOT_RUN; no metric advantage or general prose claim.

## Ordered correspondence through learned context projection — September 14, 2026

**PASS_ORDERED_CORRESPONDENCE.** [Result](../native_geometric_correspondence_973.md) and [evidence](../evidence/native_geometric_correspondence_973.json). Actual training revalidation 2,816/2,816; new development 384/384 full answers, paths, spans/bounds, payloads, queries and encodings; all 32 families and reloads. All 6,304 earlier complete traces are retained, including 512 typed unresolved outcomes. Separately, 296/296 and 384/384 successful traces from both previous failed occurrence candidates are preserved. ExactIdentity equals Full; normal model 15baec48 remains unchanged and unpromoted. Familiar authored grammar and inherited finite roles remain limits; final independent holdout NOT_RUN.

One fit selected [851970], but raw source adjacency lost 960 earlier traces containing “trust.” Projecting source adjacency through the inherited learned context-only roles preserves intervening function words while still rejecting content gaps, repeated occurrences and reversed order. Explicit schema 2 reuses the same fitted rule with no second fit and passes every retained trace. Restoring raw gaps reproduces all 6,304 first-candidate responses and the same 960 failures (5,344 complete-struct plus 960 compact-response comparisons). StructureDisabled loses 88 overlap successes; the joint non-injective/structure-disabled control reproduces the wrong multiplicity answer from the same actual payload/query. Earlier phrase controls replay 6,048/6,048 through their original parent; older adapter controls were not rerun.

**Current next action:** Test the unchanged qualified wrapper on phrases with the same word multiset in different orders, plus gapped distractors under the same relation. Freeze baseline, active-order change, inactive-source change, missing exact compatible endpoint and conflicting exact endpoint cases within the existing two-read/four-record bounds. Use an independent raw full-phrase oracle; record actual selected payload, updated query, source path, answer/EOS and typed unresolved reason, with StructureDisabled as a matched control. Begin without fitting. The current evidence does not yet establish order-permuted endpoint discrimination under the same relation. Preserve all current full traces, missing/conflict behavior and the normal model; do not widen depth or restart broad research first.

Candidate SHA256 1838cc12bda863c769db9239d7b225e91dd82856c7e90bf7427abffb5a9e1b23; embedded span parent 44c0 unchanged. All failed candidates and three source/binary versions retained. Five new sealed reports bring preservation to 64 roots/1,620 files; both original dirty checkouts unchanged. Three successful optimized builds, one corrected compile failure and 59 focused tests. Model charge 667826/1200000 ms; parent 10940809/11910000; shared 130691382/132950000. Pre-recorded parent extensions +600000 ms/+256 MiB, shared ceilings unchanged. No external cost or cleanup.

## Overlapping occurrence correspondence — September 14, 2026

**FAIL_OCCURRENCE_CORRESPONDENCE.** [Result](../native_geometric_occurrence_973.md) and [evidence](../evidence/native_geometric_occurrence_973.json). Unchanged-artifact diagnosis reproduces 144/384 complete answers, with all 240 overlapping cases failing. Candidate-specific injective occurrence witnesses improve this to 296/384 while retaining all 6,304 earlier full traces. One bounded rule-extension fit reaches 384/384 new cases, but only 1,904/2,816 training and 3,992/6,304 earlier full traces; both corrections remain unqualified. The multiplicity guard passes; ExactIdentity equals Full, read/update controls behave as required. Retain normal model 15baec48 and experimental phrase/span artifact 44c0; no promotion.

The no-fit collision diagnostic establishes a 1,904/2,816 ceiling for the frozen 137-proposal family under zero incompatible admission. All 912 excluded rows have a sole reachable target sharing a proposal-admission signature with an incorrect span. A representative correct witness and an incorrect split repeated-word witness share mask 350879; the negative has an additional witness, so complete feature sets are not equal. Ordered assignments remain available before aggregate feature reduction. This is a concrete information-use bottleneck, not a whole-architecture impossibility result.

**Current next action:** Preserve ordered matched runs and source gaps from each existing query_to_source witness before reducing it to span features. First use the sealed collision pair and earlier styled questions to verify that a bounded correspondence representation distinguishes split repeated-word matches while retaining legitimate question/source reorderings. Then learn its compatibility inside the same output-trained selector, with a structure-disabled matched control and full new/retained generation. Do not hard-code names, phrase answers or a universal monotonic word order; do not retry the unchanged 137-mask family or relax retention. Keep whole-phrase transport, multiplicity, unresolved behavior and the primary geometry intact. This is the next source-supported hypothesis, not an implemented or qualified correction.

Four optimized builds, 54 focused tests, one fit, two failed correction reports and one no-fit collision diagnostic. 55 prior roots/1,361 files and original checkouts preserved; four new reports bring the total to 59 roots/1,499 files. Failed candidate SHA256 8e32ec603a6e40a3fc9a9a6db0a92a92eb6917f57ff93d022a561d0fddc04459 is retained at its original sealed path. Prior phrase controls replay 6,048/6,048 through the old parent; this does not override new-path regressions. Older adapter controls were not rerun. Familiar authored grammar; final holdout NOT_RUN.

## Whole-phrase intermediate query updates — September 14, 2026

**PASS_WHOLE_PHRASE_QUERY_UPDATE.** [Result](../native_geometric_phrase_update_973.md) and [evidence](../evidence/native_geometric_phrase_update_973.json). The unchanged span artifact now passes 864/864 answers, source paths, selected spans/bounds, full intermediate queries and canonical query encodings, all 72 matched families and reloads. Phrases occur in first, middle or both update positions. UpdateFirstWord loses all 576 multiword cases; StalePayload loses all 288 active-source cases while preserving all baseline/inactive cases. One build/evaluation, zero fits or retries; all learned parameters unchanged. ExactIdentity equals Full. Familiar authored grammar, explicit sequential references and finite word roles remain limits; final holdout NOT_RUN. Retain 15baec48, no promotion.

The new Full path preserves 5,440 previous full traces/decisions, including prior multiword terminal answers and 512 typed unresolved cases. Separately, all 19,008 prior span-control responses and older legacy controls remain identical. Three new plus 44 retained focused tests pass. All 54 prior roots / 1,334 files, predecessor sources/binaries and original dirty checkouts are preserved; one new 27-file report brings the total to 55 roots / 1,361 files. Artifact SHA256 44c0ebf482d5807354a2e2b4c3fd6ceb310dd076ce199536f801f6cad472264b is unchanged. This is an explicit bounded payload-window extension in the same learned updater/completion loop, not a newly fitted model.

**Current next action:** Test overlapping lexical occurrences between the known query phrase and the answer using the unchanged artifact first. Freeze matched disjoint/overlapping phrase, repeated-word, role-reversal and source-change cases; record exact query-to-source occurrence matches, span features, admitted candidates and actual one/two-read outputs. The current span reader marks every source word matching any query word as a payload barrier, so shared words may erase the distinction between the known endpoint and answer. This is a source-level prediction, not yet a measured failure. If reproduced, preserve an occurrence-specific match correspondence before considering refitting; do not add a name exemption or train on unchanged collapsed features. Retain whole-phrase transport, prior answers and typed unresolved behavior; no new depth ladder or broad research restart.

## Learned contiguous terminal spans — September 14, 2026

**PASS_TYPED_LANGUAGE_SPAN.** [Result](../native_geometric_language_span_973.md) and [evidence](../evidence/native_geometric_language_span_973.json). Direct training 2,624/2,624; development 1,728/1,728 answers, paths, word spans and byte bounds across one/two/three reads and one/two/three-word terminal answers; all 48 matched families and reloads pass. The unchanged one-word parent passes only 576/1,728. Candidate admission preserves occurrence identity separately from byte extent; one learned conjunction uses retained match topology and an output-derived local context boundary. Reader/updater/writer/completion parent parameters are preserved except the new span selector/context operator. ExactIdentity equals Full; no metric advantage or general prose claim. Final holdout NOT_RUN; retain 15baec48, no promotion.

First attempt exposed 976 structurally inseparable training rows and stopped without fitting. Second attempt fit every training row but failed development and retention because unused records supplied incorrect context credit. Third attempt intersects context evidence across actual answer/EOS-compatible source spans and preserves the learned rule [327682]; no second rule search. Full transfers all 3,712 earlier answer/unresolved outcomes, and separate legacy controls replay identically. Four new plus 40 retained focused tests pass. All 51 prior roots / 1,265 files and original checkouts are preserved; all three new attempts are sealed, giving 54 roots / 1,334 files. Candidate 44c0ebf482d5807354a2e2b4c3fd6ceb310dd076ce199536f801f6cad472264b; completion parent f9e1f5aeef918d0fe6b463cd75986847d551aa8049c9f1c85b1d6d46c55a1e1f.

**Current next action:** Carry a selected multiword value through the existing query-update operator as an intermediate reference, so a later geometric read depends on the entire phrase. Begin with the explicit one-word guards in dependent_language/runtime.rs::splice and updates, and preserve exact span identity and ordered query encoding. Freeze a small mixed terminal/intermediate phrase corpus with a later-component-only change, changed active source, unchanged inactive source and truncated/stale payload controls. Try the current span rule, completion policy and writer without refitting first; preserve all current answers and typed unresolved cases. Multiword copying remains distinct from general prose and arbitrary discourse reference.

## Completed answers versus unresolved continuation — September 13, 2026

**PASS_TYPED_LANGUAGE_COMPLETION.** [Result](../native_geometric_language_completion_973.md) and [evidence](../evidence/native_geometric_language_completion_973.json). The frozen predecessor prematurely emitted intermediate answers on 1,024/1,024 unresolved diagnostic rows. One pending-clause bit and an output-trained Unresolved action correct this: training896/896; development384 valid answers plus512 typed unresolved results, all128 matched families. Both removal controls lose all512 unresolved successes. Only warm-started policy row11 changes; reader/updater/writer and prior parameters stay frozen. Missing-compatible and ambiguous routes remain local reasons, not proof of global absence. Familiar authored grammar and internal result types remain explicit. Final holdout NOT_RUN; retain15baec48, no promotion.

The new Full policy transfers 2,816 earlier successful traces exactly. Separately, all prior control rows replay identically through the unchanged parent, including19,200 depth rows.

**Current next action:** Extend the existing occurrence reader and recurrent writer to a bounded contiguous multiword answer, beginning with a source audit of candidate admission and span boundaries. Current relative_language candidates each expose one word, so preserve exact occurrence identity separately from the selected span and do not expect more scalar features to reconstruct an erased boundary. Freeze a small raw-language mixed one-word/multiword task with changed active text, unchanged inactive text, cursor/boundary controls and retained one/two/three-read plus unresolved behavior. Learn selection/emission from final text and EOS; no gold span or answer length enters serving. Reuse this completion policy and existing geometry, without another depth ladder or broad audit. Phrase copying will still not qualify general prose.

## Third dependent language read — September 13, 2026

**PASS_THIRD_LANGUAGE_READ.** [Result](../native_geometric_language_depth_973.md) and [evidence](../evidence/native_geometric_language_depth_973.json). Unchanged artifact 62da0bfaddb37452a5ec7eb1aa220fbda7b33c79ef3dbcd4da1dcb11293e7a95 passes 1,280/1,280 answers and exact three-source paths; all 64 families complete. No fit or parameter change. Clause admission extends two→three within existing byte/word/read/step bounds. Two silent Reads use the latest intermediate; all emission occurs at the third clause. SecondUpdateDisabled and StaleSecondPayload each lose all answers while preserving the earlier transition and incoming second state/source. Both isolate the second committed query on all 1,280 rows. ExactIdentity/FeedbackDisabled pass fully; no new metric/feedback advantage. Familiar names/grammar and explicit sequential references remain limitations; independent final holdout NOT_RUN. Retain15baec48, no promotion.

All earlier controls remain equal, including 9,984 dependent and separate 19,968 scheduling / 19,968 output-credit rows. One new plus 37 retained focused tests pass. All 48 earlier sealed roots / 1221 files, predecessor source/executable and original dirty checkouts are preserved. New report has 13 sealed files; one build/evaluation, zero fits/retries.

**Current next action:** Distinguish completed answers from unresolved required continuations. First run a small frozen-artifact diagnostic comparing a direct question, a valid dependent question, a source-only missing compatible continuation and a source-only conflicting continuation. Capture pending-clause state, update admission, next-route status, policy row and actual output/EOS. The source currently collapses final and unusable pending continuations into the same observation; premature completion is a source-level prediction, not a newly measured failure. If reproduced, separate pending-clause presence from continuation availability and preserve a typed unresolved outcome without claiming that rejected routes prove missing facts. Retain all successful one/two/three-read paths; do not add another depth ladder or broaden answer length before this completion distinction is reliable.

## Shared final-output reader and updater credit — September 13, 2026

**PASS_SHARED_LANGUAGE_OUTPUT_CREDIT.** [Result](../native_geometric_language_credit_973.md) and [evidence](../evidence/native_geometric_language_credit_973.json). Four fixed blocks learn reader/updater rules from empty lists, with explicit direct bootstrap and final-output suffix re-execution; scheduler and writer remain frozen. Training 4,096/4,096; development 1,536/1,536 answers/paths and 96 complete families. All 4 blocks preserve prior training successes. Mixed reader 6,144/6,144 sites, 5,120 nonlocal-positive and 2,560 shortcut-positive candidates. Final reader [1282,68098] and updater [3] equal parent/bootstrap: no incremental accuracy gain from mixed credit. Independent final holdout NOT_RUN; retain 15baec48, no promotion.

Explicit punctuation, fixed encoding, one-word updates and familiar authored grammar remain limitations; no new metric, general-language or energy claim.

**Current next action:** Evaluate a bounded third dependent language read using the unchanged fitted reader, updater and scheduler before considering any refit. The existing Frame and shared transition already advance clause/query state and permit four reads; only the two-clause admission limit needs a scoped extension. Freeze a separate Rust depth-transfer corpus with first/middle/terminal/inactive source interventions and a second-update-specific control. Retain all one/two-read panels and current byte/word limits. No depth-specific learned table, new parser, old-fit replay or broad audit.

## Shared learned language scheduling — September 13, 2026

**PASS_SHARED_LANGUAGE_SCHEDULING.** [Result](../native_geometric_language_scheduling_973.md) and [evidence](../evidence/native_geometric_language_scheduling_973.json). One fit learns a shared eight-row Read/Emit/Stop table from actual final-output trajectories. The same loop passes 4,096/4,096 training and 1,536/1,536 development answers and paths, all 96 intervention families and all six direct/dependent × lexical/construction/joint cells. Fixed second-read dispatch is removed. Punctuation supplies one/two clauses; actual usable continuation is a policy feature. Reader, updater, encoder and writer remain frozen. Retain 15baec48; no promotion.

Continuation/read-substitution controls preserve all 768 direct answers and remove all 768 dependent successes; policy/read/cursor/stop suppression and AlwaysRead yield zero answers. ExactIdentity and FeedbackDisabled pass fully. All development feature rows were seen during training, and this reuses prior development corpora; no unseen-depth, independent final holdout, metric advantage or general-language claim. All 1,536 traces reload. Seven retained panel totals (13,248 / 512 / 640 / 1,408 / 128 / 9,984 / 9,984) remain identical. Two new and 34 retained focused tests pass. One build/fit/report, no retry or old-fit replay. 46 prior sealed roots / 1,183 files and original dirty checkouts preserved.

**Current next action:** Give the reader compatibility and query-update operators shared final-output credit inside this same language loop, using the learned scheduler as a warm start. Begin with a bounded mixed direct/dependent language task and actual suffix re-execution after each changed early selection; expose training conflicts before fitting and preserve all current source interventions and prior outputs. Keep supplied punctuation and fixed encoding explicit. This addresses frozen primitive learning rather than adding another scheduling-only mechanism or a broader metric panel. Do not restart the broad audit, old fits, parked repair or V3–V7.

## Dependent language binding — September 13, 2026

**PASS_DEPENDENT_LANGUAGE_BINDING.** [Result](../native_geometric_dependent_language_973.md) and [evidence](../evidence/native_geometric_dependent_language_973.json). One fit learns one query-update rule from actual final answer/EOS; training 2,048/2,048, development answers and exact two-read paths 768/768, all 48 intervention families. Lexical, active-component-combination and joint panels each 256/256. The selected intermediate changes the second actual source and final output through a shared silent Read followed by the existing writer. Fixed two-question punctuation and scheduling, frozen reader/writer and one-word substitution remain explicit limits. General reference resolution and prose are unqualified. Retain 15baec48; no promotion.

Initialization and all ten required controls yield zero complete answers. ExactIdentity and FeedbackDisabled yield 768/768: no geometric metric or emitted-feedback advantage is claimed. Final holdout NOT_RUN. All six retained panel totals (13,248 / 512 / 640 / 1,408 / 128 / 9,984) remain identical; 768 new trajectories reload. Three new and 31 retained focused tests pass. First report stopped on the read-count assertion; report-only correction reuses the identical candidate/data/acceptance in a separately sealed attempt, with no second fit. 44 earlier sealed roots / 1161 files and original dirty checkouts remain preserved.

**Current next action:** Extend the existing dependent language runtime into one shared Read/Emit/Stop loop for mixed direct and dependent questions. Learn scheduling from actual final answer plus EOS, initially reusing the reader, writer and learned substitution. The same artifact/path must preserve direct answers, dependent source switches and all older controls. Do not supply a gold read count or intermediate path; keep any punctuation/clause boundaries explicit. This removes unconditional second-read dispatch before further grammar expansion. No broad audit, isolated metric panel, old fits or V3–V7 restart.

## Learned contextual language relation — September 13, 2026

**PASS_CONTEXTUAL_LANGUAGE_RELATION.** [Result](../native_geometric_language_relation_973.md) and [evidence](../evidence/native_geometric_language_relation_973.json). One fit gives 128/128 development answers and exact source/word occurrences, eight complete intervention families and 512/512 training. Development names, verbs and answer strings are absent from training; grammatical forms are shared. Initialization, read/scorer/order/relation-position/candidate-position/cursor/stop interventions yield zero complete answers. Candidate SHA256 `d1883e09fade8c5337fb604bf6af74556b0f18decdf745ba68bc832a9e4a74ce`; retain `15baec48`, no promotion.

Inputs are four raw sentences and a question, with generic lexical boundaries instead of supplied sequence keys. Two learned three-predicate rules select among all 16 word occurrences using fixed ordered geometric word comparisons; no gold source/word labels enter training. The encoder and earlier parameters stay frozen. The existing learned byte/EOS writer supplies lexical stopping through the shared transition, without new action rows. ExactIdentity, FinalRootOnly and FeedbackDisabled also pass 128/128: this task demonstrates learned structural relation selection, not a geometric metric advantage, feedback-dependent selection, learned whole-question encoder or general prose. Four-word syntax remains a material limit.

All 13,248 retained outputs, 512 recurrent traces and 640 ordered control outputs/paths remain identical, with explicit count checks. One new plus 26 retained focused tests pass; 128 new Full traces reload. All 41 earlier sealed roots / 1,125 files and original dirty checkouts remain preserved. One fit/report, no refit or data filtering. Routing status distinguishes ambiguity, unsupported context and no compatibility; none proves absent information.

**Current next action:** Replace fixed four-word positional features with shared relative-position/context representation and learn across mixed sentence/question lengths and constructions. Keep role reversals, changed-source controls, separate lexical/syntactic transfer measurements and retained behavior. Reuse the reader and recurrent writer; avoid an extra hardcoded parser or answer-family rule for each phrasing. This advances reusable contextual binding toward dependent language reads and prose. No broad audit, V3–V7/old-fit replay or parked-repair restart.

**PASS_ORDERED_GEOMETRIC_STATE.** [Result](../native_geometric_ordered_state_973.md) and [evidence](../evidence/native_geometric_ordered_state_973.json). Actual development: 64/64 answers and source paths, 16/16 complete order/content families; initialization and eight required controls 0/64. FinalRootOnly diagnostic 56/64. Training 256/256; one finite selection among 16 shared operation pairs chooses Right/Left composition. Candidate SHA256 `dc15055718fff00c166c2c9ad5d21dd0f1d93ebff76b3c89e64fb5cf8c0b2486`. Retain `15baec48`; no promotion.

Signed H4 prefix histories now support order-sensitive query updates in the shared read/emit/stop transition. Canonical prime identities remain separately at each occurrence. New prefix routing uses strict structural Hamming compatibility; the byte adapter retains its old learned reader. Action/writer/advance remain frozen. Zero full-prefix collisions versus 52 final-product collisions in 1,920 within-context observations. Supplied opaque keys/spans, reused development answer strings and fixed canonical key encoding remain explicit limits. This is output-supervised finite operator selection, not semantic attention learning or general prose.

All 13,248 prior retained outputs and 512 complete recurrent control traces remain identical; 64 new Full trajectories reload. One new focused test and 25 retained tests pass. A boundary fixture was corrected to the learned span context after the first report stopped; the identical fitted candidate was reused, with no refit or change to data/acceptance/model source. Both sealed reports/source/binaries, 39 earlier roots / 1,102 files, original dirty checkouts and normal model are preserved.

**Current next action:** Learn shared contextual compatibility/query formation on a small language relation task with role reversals and changed-source controls, where exact supplied sequence-key equality is insufficient. Reuse ordered history, exact identity and the shared recurrence; train from actual answers and recompute downstream choices. Keep supplied span boundaries and credit scope explicit. The owner's OSPF analogy and verified SpiralCore negative-route cache inform separation of route existence, lawful alternatives, admission, incomplete search and learned relevance; they do not require a separate routing protocol project. No broad audit or V3–V7/parked-repair restart.

Retain `15baec48`; no promotion.

One shared2,048-row action policy now chooses silent reads, byte emission and stopping over the frozen learned reader/writer/advance/query-update operators. Actual emitted bytes accumulate pending query state and boundary reads commit it. Single-pass output-derived action fitting changes254rows; training13,312/13,312. All new development feature rows were seen in training; this is compositional trajectory transfer, not unseen-feature or joint primitive learning. Supplied bindings/span boundaries and the observable context-length feature remain explicit. Whole-span XOR accumulation loses order; it is lexical-address composition, not semantic geometric transport.

Attempt1 failed eight retained punctuation/EOS cases despite64/64new answers.

**Current next action:** Implement and train order-sensitive geometric state in this integrated recurrence, using a small contextual relation task where reordered occurrences of the same tokens require different generated answers. Reuse existing signed finite group composition and the H1 research; preserve exact occurrence identity/orientation and check actual representation collisions before fitting. Train state/query decisions against output and retain this integrated control. A noncommuting operator alone is not language acceptance; common primitive learning, raw-language binding and general prose remain unfinished.

## Learned variable-length grounded text — September 13, 2026

**PASS_GROUNDED_VARIABLE_TEXT.** [Result](../native_geometric_text_attention_973.md) and [evidence](../evidence/native_geometric_text_attention_973.json). One fit produces 64/64 development spans exactly through EOS, 32/32 complete changed-source pairs and 48/48 answers longer than the longest training answer (18 bytes; long development 25–32). Training 512/512. Initial and all five disabled/reversed controls 0/64. The new text loop preserves 8,256 prior one-read answers; the separately retained historical adaptive mode preserves 2,240 mixed-depth examples. Candidate SHA256 `22b1df1c6b5721ea71d0bad40ab968434b63397c7819213aec046c7def6af63e`. Retain `15baec48`; no promotion.

Eight byte/EOS writer tables and one cursor-advance entry changed; the warm reader's exported tables did not. This is supplied-span copying, not novel prose. Exact query encoding/bindings/boundaries are supplied; the query stays fixed. The cursor policy sees presence and the emitted non-EOS event, not byte identity. Training uses alternating teacher-position output objectives, not end-to-end trajectory gradients. Historical multi-hop read control is preserved separately, not integrated into the text loop. Common recurrent learning and final independent qualification remain NOT_RUN.

**Current next action:** Integrate dependent source selection and variable-length emission in one recurrent path on short grounded multi-span answers. Require earlier selected/emitted content to affect the later query and recompute all downstream decisions. Inspect representation and action-class collisions before freezing the task; train against output, preserve both text and typed read controls through the combined path, and keep exact bindings, fixed operators and auxiliary supervision explicit. This continues H1; it does not restart a broad audit, old fits or V3–V7.

## Learned adaptive read/emit loop — September 13, 2026

**PASS_TYPED_ADAPTIVE_READ_EMIT.** [Result](../native_geometric_adaptive_attention_973.md) and [evidence](../evidence/native_geometric_adaptive_attention_973.json). One fit:192/192 development answers at correct depth,96/96 complete changed-source pairs,32/32 four-read cases absent from training. Training2048/2048. AlwaysEmit96/192; FixedTwo56/192; AlwaysRead/ReadDisabled0/192. Update/payload-disabled lose all96long cases. New adaptive loop AND old paths preserve8256one-read and2176dependent cases.

Only the byte-indexed read/emit policy is newly learned; reader/update/codec frozen. Final-answer-derived action supervision learns the declared terminal/link byte domain. All development action bytes are seen in training; transfer is context/depth, not unseen content classes. No hop count or stopping oracle enters inference. The four-read cap returns failure on exhaustion. Single-byte+EOS output, supplied records and separate curricula remain limitations; joint language training and final independent holdout NOT_RUN.

**Current next action:** Connect the learned loop to short variable-length text, updating state after each emitted byte and learning state-conditioned byte/EOS decisions under a common output objective with interacting query/update/read parameters. Inspect actual representation dependencies, freeze a small text task and changed-source/context-disabled controls, and retain the typed one-/two-/mixed-depth controls before fitting. Keep supplied bindings/auxiliary supervision explicit. No broad audit, old-fit restart or V3–V7 replay.

## Learned dependent query update — September 13, 2026

**PASS_TYPED_DEPENDENT_QUERY_LEARNING.** The [implemented result](../native_geometric_dependent_attention_973.md) and [source-bound evidence](../evidence/native_geometric_dependent_attention_973.json) establish a trained 16-table query update between two actual retained geometric reads. Development128/128 exact answers, second queries and both selections;64/64 changed-first-source pairs complete. Untrained update32/128; update-disabled and payload-disabled0/128; prior-query-disabled32/128 answers but0correct queries; second-read-disabled0/128answers with128correct queries. Training2048/2048.

The single256epoch fit learns a typed bitwise address-composition curriculum. It derives auxiliary query labels from actual successful suffix answers; the expected-query oracle does not enter training or serving. Reader/codec, paired-bit topology and two-read schedule remain fixed. This is not joint gradient learning through retrieval, raw prose or a learned R4 transport law. Final holdout NOT_RUN. Five new and nine retained focused tests pass; reload2176outputs equal. All34prior sealedroots/1050files and original checkouts preserved.

**Current next action:** Continue H1 with learned read-versus-emit control and repeated use of the update on a small mixed-depth composition task. Preserve the one-read and dependent-read controls; recompute all later decisions under changed early sources. Do not supply a final hop count or authored stopping rule as learned behavior. Freeze the typed task, controls and complete cumulative projection before fitting. Variable-length output/raw-text and joint predictive learning remain subsequent responsibilities; no broad audit or V3–V7 replay.

## Learned typed one-read attention — September 13, 2026

**PASS_TYPED_ONE_READ_ATTENTION_LEARNING.** The [implemented learning result](../native_geometric_relational_attention_973.md) and [source-bound evidence](../evidence/native_geometric_relational_attention_973.json) establish learned compatibility and byte/EOS decoding on four supplied typed records. Final development64/64 exact answers and selections;32/32 changed-source pairs both exact. Same fitted codec with uniform routing16/64; ReadDisabled and QueryReversed0/64. Training8192/8192. Final candidate SHA2569901cc50d36d32b4c41f24db2c5f3af41b7cb1f2eaa77ff6e7dcde339e66a582. Retain15baec48; no model promotion.

This completes the first compatibility/decoder boundary of H1, not its joint learned query/state recurrence. Fixed canonical query/key encoding and supplied record boundaries remain explicit. Four preserved attempts yielded14,16,42,64 development successes; hard-export learning and training feature coverage were corrected within budget. All64 development rows and gate thresholds stayed unchanged. Final holdout NOT_RUN. Full cross-lane information did not improve this simple task over DiagonalOnly; phase removal lost70 training answers but no development answers. General prose and harmonic/E8 completion remain unqualified.

**Current next action:** Extend H1 to a learned dependent query/state update: first-read content must determine the second actual read, with changed-source, update-disabled and restricted-context interventions. Preserve this first-learning artifact/control, recompute downstream decisions and freeze the small task plus complete projection before fitting. Do not restart broad research, old failed fits or V3–V7.

## Deep geometric-attention research — September 13, 2026

**SELECTED_RELATIONAL_GEOMETRIC_LEARNING_HYPOTHESIS; model remains UNQUALIFIED_INITIALIZED_NO_FIT.** The [research synthesis](geometric-attention-research-2026-09/README.md), mathematical/learning/source companions and [coverage inventory](geometric-attention-research-2026-09/coverage.json) consolidate the owner's broad research request. No model execution, fit, runtime change or V3–V7 replay occurred. Retain15baec48 and all initialized/negative candidates. Prior Hamming trajectory conformance remains valid only at its recorded scope; no promotion follows research.

The concrete source concern is the current4096→1024→256→1796 LUT4 topology: each output bit has at most64input dependencies per call, each four-bit score at most256, with repeating input-cone families. Argmax and recurrence broaden dependency, so this is not a total-model impossibility claim. Additional geometric inputs alone do not ensure that a decision can combine them.

**Current next action:** Implement a structured shared geometric learner with explicit relation-preserving read/update paths and an offline Rust hard-forward learning rule with declared surrogate bias. Combine the topology correction, learning update, deterministic export and first small contextual fit in one bounded implementation task; do not blindly fit the unchanged random funnel or restart the failed stochastic recipe. Keep canonical occurrence/value identity, signed H4 transport and full selected content. Make required geometry/phase/payload dependencies reachable by each relevant decision. Recompute later queries, observations and publications after changed early selections. Freeze the one-read, one-byte-plus-EOS construction/development task and complete resource projection before the fit. Require changed-source sensitivity and same-artifact ReadDisabled degradation. First learning does not require old24-panel parity; then establish dependent reads, natural prose, and only later accumulated replacement controls.

Owner ideas are retained as explicit research candidates: all-pairs small-window relative transformations, more zero-derived phase channels, ordered prime/semiprime relations, typed Euclidean/complex/Riemannian adapters, Guinand–Weil prime/zero duality, n-let span differences and exact icosian drift checks. The prime/zero bridge is a transform identity, not one-to-one numerical equality; exact canonical consistency is not semantic correctness. JEPA-like latent prediction remains a later auxiliary candidate. The source review distinguishes actual primitive implementations, manuscript claims and missing maps/learning.

Research projection: zero model ms,180000ms engineering commands,10800000ms wall,4GiB RAM,64MiB new storage,128MiB stop margin; no paid compute or cleanup.

## Shared deterministic Hamming policy — September13,2026

**PASS_HAMMING_POLICY_TRAJECTORY_CONFORMANCE; language UNQUALIFIED_INITIALIZED_NO_FIT.** [Executed result](../native_geometric_hamming_policy_973.md) and [source-bound evidence](../evidence/native_geometric_hamming_policy_973.json). Shared3076-gate policy now connects two actual Hamming reads/refinements to typed control, byte/EOS emission and observed-byte/result publication. Full selected payloads and all four start roots remain visible. Fixed whole-document parameter contrasts change81,105,80,108 selected references and7,28,7,29 teacher-predicted symbols. Reload and finite loss arithmetic agree. Eleven focused tests plus separate sealed report pass; authored canonical publication is tested. No fit or optimizer exists yet.

Actual initialized Full answers0/24; correct teacher symbols1/460; mean CE10.9981724105. All four disabled/restricted controls also0/24. Full produces no EOS within64symbols. All1536Full steps tie at maximum; EOS loses64maximum ties. A learning update must demonstrate actual winning-margin/content/EOS improvement, not only CE or causal sensitivity. Retain15baec48; no promotion. Earlier failed fits remain preserved and are not rerun.

Two builds include control-bypass correction.29prior seals/876files and original checkouts preserved. Bounded snapshot allocations remain, no energy claim.

**Next action:** First establish one learned contextual read producing a correct single byte followed by EOS on a deliberately small construction task. Vary the source value while keeping the query fixed, and compare the same artifact with ReadDisabled; demonstrate learning from parameters, not an authored routing/output fixture. Freeze that minimal acceptance and one finite dose before fitting. The existing24 older examples are observational baselines only, not pass/fail requirements for this first learning step. Do not require accumulated memory-repair, reasoning, multi-step or retained-model parity now. After the one-read task is learned, extend to genuinely dependent reads with update/restricted-context interventions; only later run the broader accumulated panels and retained regression controls when considering model replacement. Implement/select the update using the current complete deterministic trajectory reference, sharing parameters across repeated calls and recomputing downstream queries/observations/publications; declare any surrogate objective and bias. Address actual content/EOS winning margins (initialized Full had1536/1536maximum ties and EOS lost64ties) without answer overrides or silently changed tie rules. Do not resume the old per-invocation stochastic recipe or exhaustive coordinate harvesting. Preserve current initialized and negative artifacts; no promotion follows construction learning.

## Hamming contextual refinement primitive — September 13, 2026

**PASS_HAMMING_REFINEMENT_PRIMITIVES.** [Executed result](../native_geometric_hamming_refinement_973.md) and [source-bound evidence](../evidence/native_geometric_hamming_refinement_973.json). Owner adopted Hamming-based relevance inside bounded repeated contextual refinement. New Rust kernel queries, reads exact records, exposes all four selected start-context roots and full owned payload, composes working state, then queries again for1..4hops. It preserves exact references and preceding-hop provenance. Five authored cases establish changed-fourth-root→changed-second-read; disabling update or restricting to first root loses the dependency. These are selected fixture payloads, not learned/generated language. Retain15baec48; old model gate remains failed; no promotion.

All 120geometric signatures are distinct. Single-root Hamming/angle ranking agrees across856800comparisons:727320strict,129480ties,zero reversals/tie changes. Independent summed two-lane ordering and softmax weights are not certified equivalent. Candidate admission remains a bounded256occurrence/eight-result scan. Learned policy/emission, full paired-H4/fiber integration and hierarchical routing remain explicit missing work. No fit or parameter update occurred.

Seven focused release tests plus separate sealed report pass. Complete charge115442/240000ms; shared123490955/132950000ms; parent3740382/3870000ms after recorded140000ms local extension. Step96MiB,4GiB RAM,two build threads/one process,128MiB margin. Prior28sealed roots/873files and original dirty checkouts/retained model preserved. No paid compute, cleanup or V3–V7 replay.

**Next action:** Implement a parameter-bound shared query/update policy and connect the refined state plus selected exact payloads to byte/EOS emission on the same native path. Preserve bounded Hamming reads and all four selected start-context roots; do not collapse the new interface back to the old first-root summary. Define and exercise credit through earlier deterministic read/update decisions, including changed sources and later observation/publication; any surrogate must declare its bias and must not freeze pointers. Use the actual deterministic forward path as the training reference. This requires a concrete learning/integration design and complete resource projection before a fit, not another distance survey or automatic reuse of the failed temperature-one 64-update sampler. Judge actual emitted answers on dependent-read/changed-source cases with update-disabled and restricted-context controls; keep final evaluation separate and preserve retained behavior. The current authored policy and selected letters are not learning or language evidence.

## Prior matched causal-credit pilot failed — owner adopted Hamming refinement afterward

**FAIL_ADDRESSED_ATTENTION_LEARNING_PILOT.** [Executed result](../native_geometric_addressed_attention_causal_pilot_973.md) and [source-bound evidence](../evidence/native_geometric_addressed_attention_causal_pilot_973.json). One matched 64-update fit completes from original initial parameters. Development CE worsens 5.5530255→5.5711165; correctness stays 1/154 but loses the original correct symbol. Training CE improves to 5.550467 while correctness falls to 0/306. Exact answers remain 0/8 development and 0/16 training. Each saved predecessor/split loses its one correct symbol. All three causal control gates fail; no generated program qualifies for execution. Lower frozen gradient variance did not yield useful generation at this dose. Retain15baec48; no promotion.

50 focused release tests and separate fit/evaluation executions pass. Full 24-record interpreter/export trace parity passes. New checkpoint witness 3891c93a is preserved with separate causal implementation identity; no normal trained Model artifact is exported. Both new sealed attempts contain 27 files. Original checkouts, retained artifact and 26 prior roots/846 files are preserved.

Parent storage cap increased by64MiB before use; current step128MiB and128MiB stop margin. No paid compute, cleanup or V3–V7 replay. Final delivery/storage accounting appends locally.

**Next action:** Define a deterministic-forward training-credit contract and execute one finite whole-runtime causal test before another fit. State the hard-path full-document CE objective explicitly, separate from the previous expectation over stochastic paths. Change one shared LUT row or legal geometric choice, replay every affected subsequent selection, state update, acknowledgment and publication through the actual runtime, and compare executed discrete loss contrasts against a finite reference. Include repeated shared use, changed-source selection and a late offered-symbol effect; preserve target exclusion before context selection. A discrete loss contrast is not the ordinary logit derivative. Any EFD/straight-through rule must declare its surrogate/bias and recurrent addressed-memory credit; DWN local Boolean differentiation is not a drop-in backward pass. Reuse the scoped UOR/Prism/NEMESIS/Spiralcore and DWN source research. No dose increase, variance panel, isolated emission-head fit or automatic language fit. Proposed complete local ceiling: 180000ms build/test/correction, two build threads, one process, 4GiB RAM, 96MiB new storage and 128MiB stop margin.

**Next action:** Implement exact causal cost-to-go credit in the Rust learner, removing losses that precede each stochastic event while preserving the full-document objective, direct emission derivative and four-particle independent leave-one-out baseline matched to the same downstream cost boundary in the other particles. Events before CE_t receive suffix t..T; offered-symbol and observation events after CE_t receive suffix t+1..T. Count every replay if an implementation uses a second pass. Check analytic expectation and offered-symbol timing on finite causal fixtures, then make one paired frozen-checkpoint comparison against the existing estimator on the same two construction records/endpoints and eight four-particle replicates (32 shared batches). Freeze variance, mean consistency, trajectory equality and cost criteria before execution. No temperature change, corpus expansion, parameter update or new fit in that comparison.

**Next action:** One zero-update gradient/context-stability diagnostic on saved initial/final checkpoints: freeze construction records train/memory-a/0 and train/sub-9-2/0, eight independent four-particle replicates per endpoint/record with common paired RNG identities (32batches). Separate prompt/response objective, direct versus score-credit mean/dispersion by parameter family, and sampled EMIT-context support versus deterministic contexts.

## Prior addressed attention complete forward integration — learning pilot now executed

**PASS_ADDRESSED_ATTENTION_FORWARD_INTEGRATION_GATE: 29 focused release tests plus the separately invoked four-particle × 64-position dry-run. Retain 15baec48; no promotion.** The [implemented result](../native_geometric_addressed_attention_forward_973.md) and [source-bound evidence](../evidence/native_geometric_addressed_attention_forward_973.json) connect all eight phases, exact H4/prime/token/zeta bindings, selected bytes/results and learned emission. Loaded deterministic export and independent parameter interpretation have matching complete traces and snapshot continuation. Existing model dispatch/loaders remain unchanged.

The initialized artifact is 86,417 bytes, ID ac5cf4addfeca7d4346d126dcd4e3b301da2f6b597ec1b349c954023952f5719. Four frozen trajectories execute 2,001 circuit calls, 690,345 gate events and 4,561 head events. Full forward/backward takes 309,230 µs, yields 282,887 finite nonzero gradient entries, and preserves the parameter digest exactly. Dense parameters/LOO/path arrays use 31,930,368 bytes; no gate tape. The 256 positions contain no selected arithmetic; ordered arithmetic/publication pass separate focused runtime tests. This is initialized construction-only instrumentation, with zero optimizer updates or language fits. No learned language, coding, energy or allocation-free serving claim follows. Dry-run peak RSS is unavailable below the sampling interval.

Total build/test/report charge112,342/180,000 ms; shared122,861,673/132,950,000 ms; parent3,111,100/3,200,000 ms. Peak sampled build/test RSS2,564,980,736 bytes.

Both original checkouts, retained model and21 prior seals/733 files verify; no V3–V7 or old fit reran.

**Next action:** Freeze one small source-separated conversation/coding learning pilot, independent acceptance and a matched context-disabled control before fitting. Implement the Rust corpus/optimizer/checkpoint driver against the complete addressed-attention path; retain the initialized artifact baseline and qualify checkpoint/export plus deterministic generated responses separately from stochastic CE. Record complete build/preparation/fit/evaluation/correction/storage costs and any necessary preauthorized parent allowance extension before use. Select one fixed recipe and finite update cap from the measured profile with allowance for optimizer/checkpoint and longer-context costs; no automatic parameter sweep. Require changed-source generated behavior and retained controls, not construction CE alone. Proposed successor: at most64 four-particle ×64-position updates in one recipe; complete240,000 ms (140,000 build/preparation/checks,40,000 fit,30,000 evaluation,30,000 correction), two build threads/one model process,4 GiB RAM,128 MiB new storage and128 MiB margin.

## Prior addressed attention primitive and causal-credit gate — integration now delivered

**PASS_ADDRESSED_ATTENTION_PRIMITIVE_CREDIT_GATE: 18/18 release tests; retain 15baec48, no promotion.** The [implemented result](../native_geometric_addressed_attention_primitives_973.md) and [source-bound evidence](../evidence/native_geometric_addressed_attention_primitives_973.json) deliver the specification's finite LUT/sampler, exact object/lease/offer, causal input-packing and deterministic primitive-export gate. Existing dispatch/loaders remain unchanged. The new native module is isolated from the retained model.

Actual ObjectSession A/B records supply both signed H4 key lanes for changed-source credit. Four hard paths, sixteen two-particle combinations and four-particle serial leave-one-out checks match analytic/event-score/finite-difference gradients; late offered-symbol credit exercises real acknowledgment/cancellation and KEY. At p=.2,q=.7, loss .78 and gradients −.144,+.042 pass; late emission gives −.4 direct plus −.12 future. These are finite credit checks, not a language learning result. Exact identity, eviction survival, ordered scalar computation, one-time publication and pending/ready/saturated snapshots pass. Full 1024-bit reach, legal export fallback, ties and malformed primitive payloads pass.

One release build/test command charged 101,708/240,000 ms; sampled peak RSS 2,571,583,488 bytes. Shared ledger 122,749,331/132,950,000 ms; parent 2,998,758/3,200,000 ms. Retaining the tested executable brings measured step growth to 18,010,112 bytes within 96 MiB before final documentation/delivery; final receipt appends locally. No allowance extension, paid compute or cleanup. All 21 prior seals/733 files and both original checkouts verify. 140/141 prior bound sources remain byte-identical; only native_geometric/mod.rs gains the new module declaration.

The complete eight-phase model, normal model artifact and corpus learner remain NOT_IMPLEMENTED. No language fit, generation qualification, allocation or serving latency/energy measurement ran. Hamming remains an unselected comparator. SerialLoo's current dense-slice API may require two caller scratch arrays beyond its three internal accumulators; the future full caller's memory is not yet measured. Namespace/checksum trust boundaries and all prior negative candidates remain explicit.

**Next action:** Connect the tested primitives into the specified eight-phase forward/observe schedule with exact geometry/token/zeta bindings and a separately versioned normal artifact envelope. Check complete deterministic interpreter/export and snapshot continuation traces. Then execute one frozen-parameter four-particle forward/backward dry-run, measuring complete cost and scratch/tape memory before selecting a training dose. Proposed total 180,000 ms, two build threads/one model process, 4 GiB RAM, 128 MiB new storage and 128 MiB stop margin; refresh and record first. No SGD update, language fit, parameter sweep or fresh qualification draw is included. Freeze source-separated language/coding acceptance before any later fit.

## Prior addressed attention specification — primitive implementation now delivered

**SPECIFIED; implementation and learning NOT_RUN. Retain 15baec48; no promotion.** The [implementation specification](../native_geometric_addressed_attention_spec_973.md) resolves the research checkpoint into a concrete shared LUT/geometric operator design, exact object/lease lifecycle, hard-trajectory training estimator and deterministic export. Its [machine contract](../evidence/native_geometric_addressed_attention_contract_973.json) fixes dimensions, causal feature packing, legal action sets, analytic credit fixtures and proposed next costs. The prior decoder failure is preserved below; no old model run was repeated.

Selected route: bounded exact byte occurrences and owned spans → learned two-lane signed H4 access → typed selected operations/committed results → shared circuit conditioned on selected exact bytes → flat learned 257-symbol byte/EOS readout. All emitted symbols are learned; this increment includes no direct source-to-output copy bypass. UOR/occurrence identities remain distinct from geometric signatures. Hamming over hemisphere predicates is a defined comparator pending geometry-only certification, not the selected metric or a hash-distance rule. Paired-H4 companion transport and persistent learned revision writing remain explicit unfinished duties.

One shared 345-gate LUT4 circuit maps 1024 causal bits through widths 256/64/16/9 to 512 head addresses. Offline gate/operator draws occur per invocation; every reused row contributes its own event score. The loss includes exact conditional flat-head CE plus score-function credit through all hard reads/state changes, including offered-symbol effects on later acknowledgment. This differs from the failed global two-entry categorical sampler. Export stores packed truth tables, modes and full preference orders for dynamically legal spans/actions; expectation improvement does not establish deterministic generation. DWN's local EFD is deferred because it does not by itself define recurrent pointer credit.

The next implementation gate has a decisive two-step exact H4 routing fixture, repeated parameter sharing, legal-mask/export checks and exact lease/offer/snapshot tests. At p=.2,q=.7 its analytic expected loss is .78 and logit gradients are -.144,+.042; these are specified reference values, not executed test results. Corpus learning, latency/energy and new language/coding acceptance remain NOT_RUN. No production Rust change, build, training or inference occurred during this specification step.

Current step projection: 0 model/build ms, 180,000 ms engineering-command cap, 4 MiB new notes/docs; no allowance increase. Live shared ledger remains 122,647,623/132,950,000 ms and parent 2,897,050/3,200,000 ms. Proposed next primitive implementation: 240,000 ms complete build/tests/correction, 2 build threads, 4 GiB RAM, 96 MiB new storage, 128 MiB stop margin; refresh and record before use. This includes no language fit or fresh qualification draw. Source/issue/resource/preservation and independent reviews are in the established handoff shared-core-first-step/addressed-attention-spec-1/.

**Next action:** Implement the specified finite LUT/parameter sampler and exact addressed lease/offer primitives in an isolated experimental native module, then compile and run the two-step causal-gradient enumeration, direct-CE/late-emission credit, deterministic-export/legal-mask, and identity/commit/snapshot checks under the proposed 240,000 ms/96 MiB projection after refreshing live balances. Require analytic/event-score/finite-difference agreement and actual hard-path source changes before any learning recipe. Preserve old loaders/source-bound models and all prior reports. If this gate passes, profile the complete forward/backward route and freeze a source-separated causal language/coding training design and dose; do not auto-start another fit or parameter sweep from an unmeasured throughput estimate.

Worktree /Users/casey.allard/uor-r4-worktrees/shared-geometric-core, branch codex/addressed-attention-spec, based on protected merge 9ef3739d. #973 remains actively assigned/open; #964/#820 acceptance is unchanged. The canonical objective remains a learned local geometric language model with no serving matrix products/transformer/provider.

## Prior owner-directed attention reassessment — specification now delivered

**Retain 15baec48; no promotion. Stop the isolated state/head experiment sequence and specify the complete learned object/access/operator/emission route before another fit.** The owner requested research into UOR, Prism, NEMESIS and alternatives to repeated local parameter experiments. The [source and primary-literature reassessment](../native_geometric_attention_reassessment_973.md) is complete; its implementation-ready learning specification is the next work, not another automatic fit.

The current core already uses signed H4 query–key inverse-composition ranking over 32 prior records. Its prediction head sees only four geometric roots, without direct selected exact payload or committed typed-result input. UOR identity, Framework/Prism typed execution and R4's existing source/commit interfaces supply reusable pieces, but no inspected engine supplies a complete language learner. Hamming on learned/structured codes has a real sparse-distributed-memory connection to attention; Hamming on canonical hashes does not become semantic distance. NEMESIS supplies useful carrying/orientation requirements, with specific unestablished or contradicted claims recorded. Differentiable LUT/Boolean learning is a concrete candidate for offline credit assignment, with hard-serving mapping still to be designed. JEPA remains optional research. No builds, inference or fits ran after this research direction.

**Completed result: FAIL_CONTEXT_DECODER_REFIT_DEVELOPMENT_GATE.** The [four-cell comparison](../native_geometric_context_decoder_refit_973.md) passes exact baseline decoder reproduction and completes four fits. All four method contrasts and numeric model gates fail. Recombination Full parent/repeated: 100/672, NLL 3.731054; learned-repeat/repeated: 99, 3.694897; parent/varied: 81, 3.418240; learned-varied/varied: 79, 3.461138. Decoder-only adaptation lowers loss but loses 19 correct positions; learned varied state additionally worsens both measures. All 32 Full continuations remain incoherent at 96 bytes/no EOS. Useful language/Rust remains unmet.

Original attempt-1 hit its report cap after all fits and is sealed INCOMPLETE (26 files). Separate attempt-2 loads the same saved heads, performs zero fits, reproduces existing report rows exactly and seals the completed failed gate (18 files). All 28,161 prior rows / 120 outputs replay, 19 prior seals / 689 files and all parked material verify. Production code is unchanged; test drivers and source-bound witnesses are preserved. [Tracked evidence](../evidence/native_geometric_context_decoder_refit_973.json) binds the two attempts and their separate original/recovery source identities. Allocation NOT_RUN. Memory repair/V3–V7 remain parked.

Build/test/model charge: 222,406/420,000 ms; parent 2,897,050/3,200,000 ms; shared 122,647,623/132,950,000 ms. Necessary local time +200,000 ms and recovery storage +64 MiB were projected before use; shared time ceiling and parent 2 GiB storage ceiling unchanged. Execution storage 128,118,784 bytes within 192 MiB; parent growth 1,787,117,568 bytes with 128 MiB stop margin; peak sampled RSS 2,532,589,568 bytes. Final research/delivery receipt appends locally. No paid compute or cleanup.

**Next action:** Produce one implementation-ready learned addressed geometric attention specification from the reassessment: exact object/occurrence/version payload alongside learned signed geometry; bounded query/key access and typed composition; selected exact content/result connected to shared byte/EOS emission; one offline Rust credit-assignment method that accounts for discrete access and downstream trajectories; hard-export validation, decisive causal behaviors and complete laptop resource projection. Compare H4 scoring and geometrically defined learned binary-code scoring without treating hash bits as meaning. Reuse exact R4 identity/commit interfaces, not the specialized repair wholesale. Do not start another parameter/head sweep, change the objective merely by analogy, or promote a model. The detailed specification is outstanding; this research checkpoint itself claims no new trained mechanism.

Worktree /Users/casey.allard/uor-r4-worktrees/shared-geometric-core, branch codex/geometric-context-decoder-refit. Notes/evidence remain in the established project-local handoff under shared-core-first-step/context-decoder-refit-1/ and research-reset-1/. Original artifacts remain at their original paths.

## Prior matched context augmentation — historical result; next action superseded

**Retain 15baec48; no promotion. Actual gate: FAIL_CONTEXT_AUGMENTATION_DEVELOPMENT_GATE. Method gate false; both numeric model gates fail.** The [matched augmentation experiment](../native_geometric_context_augmentation_973.md) executes two 8,192-proposal state fits from 8f8 with the decoder fixed: 48 varied contexts versus four copies of 12 originals, each 2,688 positions per proposal. All 44,040,192 proposal positions use the complete causal objective and identical streams.

Repeated witness 0c934558 accepts 11 updates; varied 0c43bf3f accepts 64. Unique-document support widens (median 1 → 5), but all accepted changes are QUERY/KEY/READ, with no TRANSITION accepts in this finite stream. Recombination Full: parent 100/672, NLL 3.731054; repeated 93/672, 3.713508; varied 93/672, 3.790710. Varied Full is worse than its ContextDisabled control (103/672, 3.763306). Its own training loss improves while original/opened retention fails. Lost-correct rows against 8f8/1198/0f82/ade9/aaa1 are repeated 18/207/198/183/25 and varied 58/240/207/191/59. All 16 arm continuations remain incoherent at 96 bytes/no EOS. Probes are authored construction-family development evidence, now opened; useful language/Rust remains unmet.

Production source/geometry are unchanged. Release build, two focused tests, preparation and actual experiment pass execution checks; model gates fail. All 15,795 old rows and 60 old outputs replay exactly; 17 prior seals / 668 files, 22 parked paths and retained model verify. Each runtime census observes at most 23 prediction angular comparisons, bound 27; allocation NOT_RUN. [Tracked evidence](../evidence/native_geometric_context_augmentation_973.json) binds 139 sources, binary, both sealed roots, reviews and costs. Worktree: /Users/casey.allard/uor-r4-worktrees/shared-geometric-core, branch codex/geometric-context-augmentation. Local evidence: shared-core-first-step/context-augmentation-1/ in the established handoff. Memory repair and V3–V7 remain parked.

A 200,000 ms necessary local extension was recorded before use; shared ceiling unchanged. Added storage 53,252,096 bytes within 128 MiB; parent growth 1,658,023,936 bytes within 2 GiB with 128 MiB margin. Peak sampled RSS 2,452,766,720 bytes. No paid compute or cleanup; final engineering/delivery append locally.

**Next action:** One bounded four-cell conditional decoder-refit comparison on frozen state snapshots: parent+repeated data, learned-repeat+repeated data, parent+varied data, and learned-varied+varied data. Use the saved 48-document datasets, exact geometry/caps, one common depth-three/minimum-leaf64 rule (matching minimum-leaf16 on originals repeated four times), and no further state proposals. First require parent+repeated fitted branch payload to reproduce the original 8f8 decoder; metadata appropriately differs. Stop and diagnose a failed reproduction before interpreting other fits. Use explicit source-bound conditional-head witnesses with complete state/head/data provenance, not inherited normal artifact CIDs. Freeze all four fit calls and complete resource/acceptance limits before execution; select each head on its own construction data only, then compare now-open recombination probes, all prior rows/controls and actual generation. Separate decoder-only adaptation from the additional effect of learned state. No tuning against probes, new regularization family, JEPA loss, automatic fit campaign or promotion is included. JEPA remains a candidate auxiliary objective after this unresolved decoder interaction is measured.

## Prior active-entry scan — historical result; next action superseded

**Retain 15baec48; no promotion. Actual gate: FAIL_ACTIVE_SENSITIVITY_DEVELOPMENT_GATE.** The [active-entry scan](../native_geometric_active_sensitivity_973.md) covers 1,150 baseline-used transition/query/key/read entries: 136,851 settings including baseline, 136,612 new complete-causal evaluations and 238 reused results. It finds 213 lower-loss settings across 49 entries, establishing available directions beyond the old pair.

Selected witness aaa1abe1 changes READ index 1937 from root 119 to 107. Construction NLL improves 2.839534 → 2.836276 and correctness 166 → 168/672. That entry has one baseline construction visit; all gains are period/newline at the end of one document. Opened Full remains 52/381 but NLL worsens 3.653604 → 3.662621, with seven new losses and seven gains. All four Full continuations remain incoherent, reaching 96 bytes without EOS. Lost rows versus 8f8/1198/0f82/ade9 are 7/205/198/183; aligned root/source Hamming are 317/81 against each prior. Only the selected minimum received full controls; the other improving settings are unqualified.

Production source and geometry are unchanged. Release build, focused heterogeneous trace/lineage/coverage/selection test and the actual experiment pass execution checks; the model gate fails. Traced/native complete state, work, prediction and loss match. The 11-file attempt is sealed; all 12,636 prior rows and 48 outputs replay. Sixteen prior seals / 657 files, 22 parked paths and retained model verify. Prediction census: at most 22 angular comparisons, bound 27; allocation NOT_RUN. [Tracked evidence](../evidence/native_geometric_active_sensitivity_973.json) binds source, binary, profile, outputs, reviews and resources. Active worktree: /Users/casey.allard/uor-r4-worktrees/shared-geometric-core, branch codex/geometric-active-sensitivity. Local evidence: shared-core-first-step/active-sensitivity-1/. Memory repair and V3–V7 remain parked.

Model/build/test charge: 166,852/420,000 ms; parent 2,539,118/2,800,000 ms; shared ledger 122,289,691/132,950,000 ms. Added storage 50,954,240 bytes within 128 MiB; parent growth 1,604,321,280 bytes within 2 GiB with a 128 MiB margin. Peak sampled RSS 2,464,940,032 bytes. No allowance increase, paid compute or cleanup. Final engineering/delivery receipts append locally.

**Next action:** One bounded matched construction-context augmentation experiment, before changing the learning objective. Use Rust to prepare three distinct length-matched construction variants per original document, preserving the declared relation/program structure, for 48 documents total. Compare two state-learning arms from exact 8f8e5c34 with its decoder and geometry fixed: varied contexts versus four copies of the original 12 documents. Match byte/EOS exposure, proposal stream, complete-causal objective, full TRANSITION/QUERY/KEY/READ domain and evaluation-call/resource caps; do not shortlist the 213 observed improvements. Freeze the variant rules, source-separated composition probes, acceptance criteria and both complete budgets before either fit. Use valid tree-aware training provenance or explicit source-bound witnesses; record document support descriptively without adding a new penalty. Select each final arm on construction only, then run immediate generation and all prior/control comparisons plus the untouched probes once. This tests broader predictive support under the same objective. No decoder refit, JEPA loss, automatic training campaign or promotion is included; JEPA remains a separate candidate if the matched result warrants an objective change.

## Prior coupled-profile checkpoint — historical result; next action superseded

**Retain `15baec48`; no promotion. Actual gate: FAIL_COUPLED_PROFILE_DEVELOPMENT_GATE.** The [coupled state/emitter profile](../native_geometric_coupled_profile_973.md) completes 239 conditional head fits, beginning with exact 8f8 baseline reproduction. Unchanged [119,119] remains the unique numerical minimum, NLL 2.839534 and 166/672 correct. Refitting reduces loss for all 238 changed-coordinate settings relative to their frozen-head losses, but none beats baseline; next-best [119,48] has NLL 2.843190 and 108 correct. This is a restricted profile, not a global joint optimum.

Witness `9661d482` selects the unchanged state/head and exports no new normal model. All six panels and four Full continuations equal 8f8. Opened 52/381, NLL 3.653604; all four Full outputs remain incoherent, 96 bytes/no EOS. Prior losses 0/199/195/180 versus 8f8/1198/0f82/ade9 are inherited differences; root/source drift is zero. General language and Rust acceptance remain unmet.

Production source, inherited caps and geometry stay unchanged. Release/focused witness test and the actual experiment pass execution checks. The 512-step operation census reports <=23 prediction angular comparisons, bound 27; allocation NOT_RUN. All 12,636 prior rows and 48 outputs replay, all 239 head payloads and 489 sealed files verify, as do 15 older seals/ 168 files and 22 parked paths. [Tracked evidence](../evidence/native_geometric_coupled_profile_973.json) preserves exact lineage, fitted heads, outputs, reviews and resources. Active worktree `/Users/casey.allard/uor-r4-worktrees/shared-geometric-core`, branch `codex/geometric-coupled-profile`; local attempt `shared-core-first-step/coupled-profile-1/`. Memory repair/V3–V7 remain parked; canonical shared-core sequence remains active.

[JEPA research](../native_geometric_jepa_research_973.md) was added in response to the owner: a possible auxiliary representation-prediction objective, NOT_IMPLEMENTED/NOT_RUN and separate from this experiment.

Model/build/test charge 111,115/360,000 ms; parent cycle 2,372,266/2,800,000 ms; shared cumulative ledger 122,122,839/132,950,000 ms. The 200,000 ms local-cycle increase was recorded before use under standing owner authorization; the shared ceiling remains unchanged. Added storage 33,370,112 bytes within 128 MiB, parent growth 1,552,793,600 bytes within 2 GiB with the 128 MiB stop margin. Peak sampled RSS 2,335,850,496 bytes. No paid compute or cleanup. Final engineering and delivery receipts append locally.

**Next action:** One bounded complete-construction sensitivity scan of currently addressed TRANSITION, QUERY, KEY and READ entries under fixed 8f8e5c34. Record actual baseline parameter-address coverage and verify traced versus untraced outputs, then evaluate each legal alternative root for each active entry with full causal sequences and all other fields frozen. The declared table domain is at most 1,200 entries × 119 alternatives; freeze the actual call count, time/RAM/storage and selection rules before execution. Reuse the valid sealed single-coordinate results for 1176/1930 rather than repeating them. Select at most one construction-loss improvement and run immediate generation plus all prior/control comparisons; preserve source-bound witnesses and a no-improvement result if none exists. This tests where the current learner has an actionable update beyond the two historical entries. No head refit, fresh draw, new geometry, automatic joint campaign or JEPA training is included. JEPA remains a documented candidate auxiliary objective, requiring a separate causal, collapse-controlled design.

## Prior fixed-decoder pair checkpoint — historical result; next action superseded

**Retain `15baec48`; no promotion. Actual gate: FAIL_TREE_STATE_PAIR_DEVELOPMENT_GATE.** The [fixed-decoder recurrent/read experiment](../native_geometric_tree_state_pair_973.md) evaluates all 14,400 settings of indices 1176/1930 on complete causal construction sequences with 8f8e5c34's decoder fixed. Unchanged [119,119] is the unique numerical minimum: NLL 2.839534, 166/672 correct; next-lowest NLL 3.029702. No setting improves loss or exceeds parent correctness. This closes the declared two-entry/fixed-decoder question, not global recurrence capacity.

Test-only witness `1b33feeb` changes zero parameters and exports no new normal model artifact. All six panels and four Full generations equal 8f8. Opened Full remains 52/381, NLL 3.653604; all Full continuations remain incoherent, 96 bytes/no EOS. Lost-correct totals against 8f8/1198/0f82/ade9 are 0/199/195/180 separately, inherited from the unchanged decoder. All root/source drift is zero. Complete acceptance remains unmet.

Production source, decoder, caps and geometry are unchanged. Release compilation, one focused witness/selection test and one sealed actual experiment pass execution checks. A 512-step census observes <=23 prediction angular comparisons within the bound27; allocation measurement is NOT_RUN in this step. All 12,636 prior rows and 48 prior outputs replay exactly; fourteen prior sealed roots/158 files, retained model and 22 parked paths verify. [Tracked evidence](../evidence/native_geometric_tree_state_pair_973.json) binds the exact table, witness, source/binary, outputs, reviews and costs. Active worktree: `/Users/casey.allard/uor-r4-worktrees/shared-geometric-core`, branch `codex/geometric-tree-state-pair`; local handoff attempt: `shared-core-first-step/tree-state-pair-1/`. Canonical shared-core plan remains active and memory repair/V3–V7 remain parked.

Model/build/test charge 104,429/300,000 ms; parent cycle 2,261,151/2,600,000 ms; shared cumulative ledger 122,011,724/132,950,000 ms. A 200,000 ms local-cycle increase was recorded before use under standing owner authorization; the shared ceiling is unchanged. Added storage 26,853,376 bytes within 128 MiB; parent growth 1,518,923,776 bytes within 2 GiB with a 128 MiB stop margin. Peak sampled RSS 2,367,373,312 bytes. No paid compute or cleanup. Final engineering and delivery receipts append locally.

**Next action:** One bounded coupled state/emitter coordinate profile: the unchanged pair plus 119 alternatives for index 1176 and 119 alternatives for index 1930, changing only one coordinate at a time from [119,119] (239 unique settings). For each setting, recompute complete construction trajectories and fit one conditional angular emitter with fixed depth3/minimum-leaf16 and identical inherited caps. First require the unchanged baseline refit to reproduce exact 8f8e5c34; otherwise stop and diagnose. Freeze the full fit-call, wall/RAM/storage limits and selection/tie rule before execution. Select once using construction NLL, then run one immediate generation and all prior/control comparisons. Bind both state overrides and the actual fitted head in valid provenance or an explicit test-only witness; never identify a changed clone by an inherited CID. This tests state/decoder coadaptation, not a full coupled pair optimum. No new parameter hunt, decoder regularization family, fresh draw, iterative alternating campaign or promotion is authorized by this recommendation.

## Prior decoder-selection checkpoint — historical result; next action superseded

**Retain `15baec48`; no model is promoted. Actual gate: FAIL_DECODER_VALIDATION_DEVELOPMENT_GATE.** The [conditional decoder-validation experiment](../native_geometric_decoder_validation_973.md) executes four configurations × three document folds and one final refit. It selects depth three / minimum leaf 16, producing `8f8e5c34` with 36 trees / 184 nodes. The frozen parent already saw construction documents; this is incremental decoder selection, not independent end-to-end validation. All four pooled validation losses exceed the fixed cap comparator.

Full construction reaches 166/672 correct, NLL 2.839534. Opened Full reaches 52/381, NLL 3.653604: likelihood improves against all three priors and accuracy beats both caps, but falls below the prior tree's 57/381. Preservation fails with 195 / 180 / 199 correct-to-wrong rows against 0f82b728 / ade9a1cf / 1198ef47 separately. All four Full generations remain incoherent and hit 96 bytes without EOS. No useful language/Rust or broader qualification is established.

Production source, geometry, recurrence, routing and inherited caps remain unchanged. All root/source traces match; all 9,477 prior rows and 36 prior outputs replay exactly. Release compilation, one focused selection test, the actual experiment and a reused source-identical actual-candidate 512-step zero-allocation census pass execution checks; the model gate fails. [Tracked evidence](../evidence/native_geometric_decoder_validation_973.json) binds all source, binaries, folds, rows, outputs, reviews and costs. Thirteen prior sealed roots / 111 files, 22 parked dirty paths and retained model verify unchanged. Worktree: `/Users/casey.allard/uor-r4-worktrees/shared-geometric-core`; branch `codex/geometric-decoder-validation`; local evidence: `shared-core-first-step/decoder-validation-1/` under the established handoff.

Resource receipt: 97,800/300,000 ms model/build/test; parent cycle 2,156,722/2,400,000 ms; cumulative ledger 121,907,295/132,950,000 ms. Added storage 26,787,840 bytes within 128 MiB; peak sampled RSS 2,357,968,896 bytes. No allowance extension, paid compute or cleanup. Final engineering/delivery receipts append locally. The canonical shared-core plan remains active; V3–V7 and the dirty memory repair remain parked.

**Next action:** One bounded complete-construction recurrent/read-pair intervention with selected decoder `8f8e5c34` fixed. Project a single 120 × 120 enumeration of parameter indices 1176 and 1930, scoring complete causal sequences over all 672 construction positions; freeze all other parameters and exclude opened/control labels from selection. Prior exhaustion under the cap emitter does not establish exhaustion under this tree emitter. Bind a changed artifact with valid tree-aware provenance or use an explicitly source-bound test-only parameter witness. Compare against 8f8e5c34, 1198ef47, 0f82b728 and ade9a1cf separately, measure state/source drift, retain all preservation and generation gates, and record a negative result if the block has no improving setting. No decoder refit, larger corpus, automatic joint campaign or promotion follows from this recommendation.

## Prior angular-tree checkpoint — historical result; next action superseded

**Retain `15baec48`; no model is promoted.** The [bounded angular emission-tree experiment](../native_geometric_angular_tree_973.md) implements the prior recommendation once, with fixed recurrence/routing. The canonical shared-core plan remains active; the dirty memory repair and V3–V7 evidence stay parked and preserved.

**Actual gate: FAIL_ANGULAR_TREE_DEVELOPMENT_GATE.** The construction-only greedy fit selects 66 trees / 368 nodes, depth at most three, using signed H4 comparisons and integer leaves. Candidate `1198ef47` improves construction NLL 3.354320 → 2.444899 and accuracy 81 → 206/672. Opened accuracy also rises 33 → 57/381, but NLL worsens 3.659923 → 3.908623. Preservation fails: 188 parent-correct rows become wrong against `0f82b728` and 181 against `ade9a1cf`, compared separately across six panels. Root/source traces stay identical. All four Full generations remain incoherent; two stop at 19/65 bytes and two reach 96 bytes. No useful language or Rust result is established.

Schema 3 binds the learned trees, data/configuration, parent and implementation. It uses at most 27 angular comparisons per byte/EOS prediction and adds 19,550 serialized bytes. The change combines richer partitions and access to four state lanes, so their contributions are not isolated. Greedy immediate split search is not a global tree optimum. Existing caps, recurrence, routing and geometry remain fixed; previous artifacts replay exact saved behavior under the new loader.

The release build and 31 focused shared-core tests, one sealed actual experiment, and newly built actual-candidate 512-step zero-allocation/bounded-comparison census pass execution checks; the model gate fails. [Tracked evidence](../evidence/native_geometric_angular_tree_973.json) binds exact source/binaries, candidate, all rows/generations, research, independent review and costs. Twelve prior sealed roots / 102 files, 22 parked dirty paths and retained artifact verify. Worktree: `/Users/casey.allard/uor-r4-worktrees/shared-geometric-core`, branch `codex/geometric-angular-tree`; local attempt: `shared-core-first-step/angular-tree-1/` under the established handoff.

Resource receipt: 196,939/480,000 ms model/build/test; parent cycle 2,058,922/2,400,000 ms; cumulative ledger 121,809,495/132,950,000 ms. The 300,000 ms local allocation increase was recorded before use inside the unchanged shared ceiling. Added storage 30,879,744 bytes within 128 MiB; parent growth 1,464,291,328 bytes within 2 GiB with 128 MiB stop margin. Peak sampled RSS 2,375,303,168 bytes. No paid compute or cleanup. Final engineering/delivery receipts append locally.

**Next action:** One bounded construction-document decoder regularization-selection experiment. Freeze a small depth/support or pruning family, deterministic document folds, selection/tie rules, complete fit-call/resource caps and at most one final refit before execution. Fit each fold's tree topology, leaf scores and cap/tree selection without that fold's validation labels; do not prune the already all-document-fitted tree and call those documents held out. The frozen recurrent and cap parent already saw the construction corpus, so this is conditional decoder-selection validation, not fresh end-to-end evidence. Keep opened/control labels out of selection; retain separate comparisons to both 0f82b728 and ade9a1cf, all preservation gates and actual generation. No larger tree, corpus campaign, repeated current fit or promotion follows automatically.

## Prior final-emission checkpoint — historical result; next action superseded

**Retain `15baec48`; no model is promoted.** The [final-trajectory emission calibration](../native_geometric_final_emission_973.md) executes the prior recommended step once on `ade9a1cf`. The canonical shared-core plan remains active; memory repair stays parked and V3–V7 are not replayed.

**Actual gate: FAIL_FINAL_EMISSION_DEVELOPMENT_GATE.** One exhaustive likelihood-only pass evaluates 327,571,200 settings across 94 occupied nodes in 15.314 seconds and changes 52 emission branches. Candidate `0f82b728` improves Full construction NLL 3.375391 → 3.354320 and accuracy 79 → 81/672; opened development improves NLL 3.663040 → 3.659923 and accuracy 28 → 33/381. Conditional optimization and opened-development gates pass, but preservation fails: 35 parent-correct rows become wrong across six panels (construction 10/9/7; opened 4/4/1). All four candidate Full continuations remain incoherent, with no EOS within 96 bytes. No useful prose or Rust generation is established.

Recurrence/routing, geometry, non-emission parameters and all teacher-forced root/source traces remain unchanged. Prediction Hamming is recorded per panel as aligned categorical disagreement, not semantic distance. Saved-row equality groups force only 15 construction and 5 opened errors for an unrestricted mapping of complete root identities, versus actual 591 and 348 errors. These descriptive lower bounds are not capacity or generalization claims for the current cap class.

The release build, focused accounting test, single actual fit/behavior experiment and actual-candidate 512-step zero-allocation census pass execution checks; the model gate fails. Production source is unchanged. [Tracked evidence](../evidence/native_geometric_final_emission_973.json) binds design, source/binaries, candidate, exact rows and outputs, research, independent review and resources. Eleven prior sealed roots / 93 files, 22 parked dirty paths and retained artifact verify. Active worktree: `/Users/casey.allard/uor-r4-worktrees/shared-geometric-core`, branch `codex/geometric-final-emission`; local notes: `shared-core-first-step/final-emission-1/` in the established handoff.

Resource receipt: 108,848/300,000 ms model/build/test; parent cycle 1,861,983/2,100,000 ms; cumulative ledger 121,612,556/132,950,000 ms. Added storage 26,083,328 bytes within 128 MiB, parent growth 1,433,038,848 bytes within 2 GiB with 128 MiB stop margin. Peak sampled RSS 2,324,611,072 bytes. No allowance extension, paid compute or cleanup. Final engineering/delivery receipts append locally.

**Next action:** one bounded learned angular decision-tree emission prototype over existing signed H4 state, keeping recurrence/routing fixed. Freeze depth, node count, runtime operations, storage and complete resource limits before implementation/fit; select by construction likelihood and compare with the current two-cap emitter under all six row-preservation controls, opened-development metrics and actual generation. The richer geometric partition is a hypothesis, not established improvement. Do not repeat the identical cap fit, expand the exhausted state-block sampler, use answer overrides or start an automatic fit campaign. No promotion before acceptance.

## Prior full-objective checkpoint — historical result; next action superseded

**Retain `15baec48`; no model is promoted.** The [full-objective comparison](../native_geometric_full_objective_973.md) executes the prior recommended step from unchanged experimental parent `ade9a1cf`. The memory repair stays parked, original evidence is preserved, and V3–V7 are not replayed.

**Actual gate: FAIL_FULL_OBJECTIVE_JOINT_METHOD_SMOKE.** Four seeds × two methods × 2,050 full-construction evaluations all retain original roots [119,119] at indices [1176,1930]. Fixed joint sampling beats coordinate search 0/4 and improves parent loss 0/4. The subsequent exhaustive 14,400-pair table finds zero improving settings; the parent is the unique minimum for this block with the remainder frozen (NLL 3.375391; next setting 3.433977). Neither sampler missed an improvement in the allowed block. This is not a global model optimum or geometric capacity limit.

All eight test-only witnesses reproduce Full construction 79/672 correct, opened development 28/381, and both disabled-control panels. Across 25,272 aligned comparisons, root/source/prediction Hamming and correct-to-wrong changes are all zero. All 32 Full witness continuations equal the parent's incoherent 96-byte outputs with no EOS. No standard model artifact, fresh draw or broader fit is created. Production training, serving and artifact sources are unchanged.

The focused witness/row-comparison release test and single sealed actual experiment pass execution checks; the method gate fails. [Tracked evidence](../evidence/native_geometric_full_objective_973.json) preserves source/compiler/binary, design, witnesses, complete costs, all row comparisons and generations, independent review and cumulative charges. Active worktree: `/Users/casey.allard/uor-r4-worktrees/shared-geometric-core`, branch `codex/geometric-full-objective`. Local attempt: `shared-core-first-step/full-objective-1/` under the established handoff.

Resource receipt: 120,471/360,000 ms model/build/test, including the failed compile; parent cycle 1,753,135/2,100,000 ms; cumulative ledger 121,503,708/132,950,000 ms. Added storage 25,948,160 bytes within 128 MiB; parent growth 1,406,492,672 bytes within 2 GiB, retaining the 128 MiB stop margin. Peak sampled RSS 2,246,492,160 bytes. No allowance extension, paid compute or cleanup. Final engineering/delivery receipts append locally.

**Next action:** one exact emission-block recalibration on final `ade9a1cf` Full construction trajectories using existing Rust `calibrate_emission_blocks`. Prior exact calibration preceded the joint changes to state/routing and emission; its conditional optimum does not establish an optimum on final trajectories. Freeze one pass, full-objective/accuracy conditions, all six parent row controls, actual generation and complete resources. Keep recurrence/routing fixed and opened development outside fitting. No same-block sampler rerun, automatic alternating-fit campaign, fresh draw or promotion.

## Prior tied categorical checkpoint — historical result; next action superseded

**Retain `15baec48`; no model is promoted.** The [tied categorical learner](../native_geometric_tied_learning_973.md) now scores complete hard trajectories with each shared parameter held fixed across every use. Offline probabilities and gradients do not change the integer serving kernel. The [canonical shared-core plan](project-track.md#current-implementation-sequence--owner-adopted-september-12) remains active; the memory-completion repair stays parked and V3–V7 are not replayed.

**Actual gate: FAIL_TIED_CATEGORICAL_METHOD_SMOKE.** Four seeds, each with 2,050 evaluations per learned/fixed-joint/coordinate arm, precede a 14,400-setting exhaustive reference. Expected distribution loss improves in 4/4 seeds; hard exports beat coordinate search 4/4 but fixed joint sampling 0/4 (three ties, one loss), failing the frozen requirement of at least three wins. Oracle-gain fraction 0.788002 meets its condition. The final distributions still have worse expected loss than the unchanged hard parent.

All exports use roots [119,76], changing only read1930. Diagnostic NLL improves 3.535634 → 3.512336 on 132 targets, but complete construction worsens 3.375391 → 3.467544 and correct predictions fall 79 → 67/672. Open development NLL changes 3.663040 → 3.656606 while accuracy falls 28 → 27/381. All sixteen Full continuations remain incoherent with no EOS in 96 bytes. The four source-bound artifacts are preserved; no fresh draw or full-model fit ran. This is not a language or energy qualification.

Final-source validation: 27 focused shared-core tests, the actual sealed experiment, and the saved-candidate 512-step zero-allocation census pass their execution checks. The method gate remains failed. [Tracked evidence](../evidence/native_geometric_tied_learning_973.json) binds source, compiler, binary, all outputs, independent review and cumulative charges including the initial compile failure. Local evidence is `shared-core-first-step/tied-learning-1/`; active worktree is `/Users/casey.allard/uor-r4-worktrees/shared-geometric-core`, branch `codex/geometric-tied-learning`.

Resource receipt: 299,956/540,000 ms model/build/test; parent cycle 1,632,664/2,100,000 ms; shared ledger 121,383,237/132,950,000 ms. The local cycle allowance was increased by 500,000 ms before use within the unchanged ledger ceiling. Added storage 14,635,008 bytes within 256 MiB; peak sampled RSS 2,486,157,312 bytes within 4 GiB. No paid compute or cleanup.

**Next action:** a bounded joint-proposal versus coordinate comparison selected on the complete 672-target construction objective from unchanged `ade9a1cf`. Freeze block selection, matched calls, seeds, gates and resources first; retain complete-objective accuracy/loss, controls and actual generation. Do not scale/tune the failed categorical sampler or install oracle roots. The 132-target subset remains diagnostic; capacity, curriculum and transfer remain unresolved.

## Prior occurrence-credit checkpoint — historical result; next action superseded

**Retain `15baec48`; no model is promoted.** The [canonical shared-core plan](project-track.md#current-implementation-sequence--owner-adopted-september-12) remains active. The prior `ade9a1cf` transfer failure is preserved. The accumulated repair stays parked; no V3–V7 replay.

**Latest result: FAIL_OCCURRENCE_CREDIT_DIRECTION_PROBE.** The [Rust prototype and research-guided trace](../native_geometric_credit_assignment_973.md) tested eight hot transition/read parameters on four already-open 32-byte sequences (132 targets), with 6,171 hard suffix and 960 tied-parameter replays. None of eight proposed updates improved loss. Seven had no improving tied replacement on this panel; read parameter 1930 had 22, but the surrogate selected root 26, which worsens NLL sum by 0.959586 instead of the actual best root 76, which improves it by 3.075335. The signed oracle-gain fraction is -0.312027, failing 0.5. No artifact export, joint fit, new holdout or new free generation ran.

**Hamming and causal trace:** the read row disagrees on improvement direction for 69/120 alternatives. A bounded follow-up reproduces the prior losses and shows that changing the shared parameter alters its future accesses from nine baseline uses to five (root 26) or six (root 76), at partly different positions. The harmful update changes 40 root slots, 28 sources and 16 predictions; the better update changes 45, 24 and 9. Hamming counts aligned categorical differences, not binary distance between root IDs and not quality. Summed one-occurrence credit misses these full-trajectory interactions.

The owner-supplied [SpiralCore v68 and FBS revision 3.1](../../research/spiralcore-v68/README.md) are preserved with exact hashes. Their separation of route identity/history, chosen action and displayed observable informed this trace. The inspected IP/Bell/BFS/phase mechanisms do not supply a learned shared-parameter update rule. v63 and its Rust adapter remain unchanged. Knowledge-map and primary-research sources remain scoped navigation and method references.

Four focused tests and the separate actual probe/trace pass their execution checks; the model-method gate remains failed. Production runtime, training and artifact sources are unchanged. Source/binary/report preservation and cumulative resource receipts are bound in [the tracked evidence](../evidence/native_geometric_credit_assignment_973.json). Local evidence: `shared-core-first-step/credit-assignment-1/` in the established handoff. Active clean-delivery worktree is `/Users/casey.allard/uor-r4-worktrees/shared-geometric-core`, branch `codex/geometric-credit-assignment`.

Resource receipt: 289,229/420,000 ms model/build/test, including the corrected compiler failure and final trace build. Parent cycle 1,332,708/1,600,000 ms; cumulative ledger 121,083,281/132,950,000 ms. A 400,000 ms local cycle-allocation increase was recorded before use within the unchanged shared ledger ceiling. Added storage 43,057,152 bytes within 256 MiB; parent growth 1,364,881,408 bytes within 2 GiB. Peak sampled RSS 2,271,100,928 bytes. No ledger/storage ceiling increase, paid compute or cleanup.

**Next action:** implement a bounded categorical learner that draws each shared parameter once per model/trajectory and uses complete hard-trajectory cost, including changed future accesses. Check a small joint parameter block against an exhaustive tied-cost reference and a matched model-call baseline before a larger campaign. Do not install the descriptive root-76 witness or repeat the failed occurrence-additive surrogate. No serving mechanism or promotion is justified; state capacity, curriculum and transfer remain unresolved.

## Prior block-calibration checkpoint — historical result; next action superseded

**The owner adopted the shared-core recommendation as the current plan and authorized its first step. Retain `15baec48`; no replacement artifact is promoted.** The [canonical plan](project-track.md#current-implementation-sequence--owner-adopted-september-12) owns the new sequence and the [first-step design](shared-geometric-core-2026-09.md) defines the isolated experiment. The accumulated memory-completion repair is parked; its V7 `aede9c18` 43/43 retained-report pass does not constitute complete repair acceptance. Later repair candidates remain unqualified and preserved. Intermediate-version intent is no longer the active next action.

**Latest step:** knowledge-map, local-source and primary-paper research informed the [block-learning correction](../native_geometric_block_learning_973.md). Exhaustive numerical likelihood search found an unconstrained ASCII-branch optimum with 211/660 errors and NLL sum 406.900191, improving the old 220 errors / 414.318812 while meeting the unchanged gate. Root calibration was already optimal. A complete parameter-block move resolves this narrow coordinate-calibration failure; this does not establish an optimizer-only explanation for the whole model.

**Calibration: PASS_BLOCK_CALIBRATION.** One exhaustive likelihood-only sweep across 94 occupied byte-tree nodes, 327,571,200 settings and 15.198 seconds produced block parent `4d83b1bb`: construction NLL 3.473156 → 3.422394 and correct byte/EOS predictions 65 → 80/672. Root 12/672 and ASCII 211/660 meet the original conditions. The old `968cf841` failure remains sealed. Recurrence and the serving equation did not change during calibration.

**Joint fit: FAIL_CONTEXTUAL_TRANSFER_SMOKE.** One seed-443 fit completed 100,000 proposals in 31.444 seconds, accepting 149. Candidate `ade9a1cf` changes construction NLL 3.422394 → 3.375391 but accuracy 80 → 79/672. On the previously unopened 381-position authored draw, legacy / prior-coordinate / block-parent / joint NLL are 5.747049 / 3.685167 / 3.707224 / 3.663040; correct predictions are 2 / 29 / 29 / 28. Joint improvement over block parent is only 1.19185% (required >2%), and accuracy regresses by one. Context removal increases loss 1.10791%, satisfying that scoped >1% condition; prior-root removal increases it only 0.27630%, failing its condition. All four Full joint continuations remain incoherent, with no EOS within 96 bytes. No model is promoted.

Eighteen focused shared-core tests pass on the source before two final deadline-return guards; the final release executable and actual model/generation/allocation runs use the corrected source. The saved-state arithmetic audit and actual-candidate 512-step zero-allocation census pass. The integer serving-kernel source is byte-identical to the preceding commit. [Exact evidence](../evidence/native_geometric_block_learning_973.json) binds all stages, controls, outputs, source/compiler/binaries and reports. Active local evidence is `shared-core-first-step/loss-frontier-1/` in the established handoff. Retained `15baec48`, the original dirty repair and all prior sealed paths remain preserved.

Resource receipt: 331,322/450,000 ms model/build/test; parent cycle 1,043,479/1,200,000 ms; cumulative ledger 120,794,052/132,950,000 ms. Conservative added storage 17,362,944 bytes within 256 MiB; parent growth 1,321,660,416 bytes within 2 GiB. Peak sampled process-tree RSS 2,308,669,440 bytes within 4 GiB. No model/storage extension or paid compute; a new one-hour local continuation window was explicitly recorded before execution. Final engineering/delivery receipts append locally.

**Next action:** implement a bounded offline categorical credit-assignment prototype for the existing shared finite state/read parameters. Keep actual hard geometric choices in the forward path and export only discrete parameters. Test surrogate-proposed directions against enumerated actual hard-loss changes on a small development sequence before another joint-training campaign. This is a proposed training change, not a selected relaxation or new serving mechanism. State capacity, data scale and curriculum remain unresolved. Preserve this candidate and opened draw as development evidence; no unchanged fit, gate relaxation, output override or promotion.

Earlier shared-core checkpoints follow; their dated next actions are superseded by the action above.

Implementation is in `/Users/casey.allard/uor-r4-worktrees/shared-geometric-core`, historical delivery branch `codex/geometric-loss-frontier`, using `native_geometric/shared_core` for canonical H4 finite-table recurrence, bounded geometric reads and byte/EOS binary-tree decisions. Offline joint coordinate fitting uses the actual hard forward path. The experiment has no inherited additive predictor fallback. Exact addressed memory, typed operators and existing serving/session integration are not connected to this prototype.

**Actual gate: `FAIL_CONTEXTUAL_TRANSFER_SMOKE`.** The sole fit exhausted its 100,000-proposal cap in 28.005 seconds, accepting 440 proposals across all nine parameter families. Training NLL decreased from 5.820628 to 5.223800 over 672 positions, with greedy byte/EOS accuracy 4 → 25. On the 249 held-out positions, NLL decreased only 1.425% (5.792988 → 5.710435; the frozen requirement was greater than 2%) and accuracy fell 2 → 0. Removing context raised NLL only 0.0686%, and removing prior-root injection only 0.1226%, both below their required 1%. None of the four full candidate generations produced a useful language or Rust continuation; two reached EOS, compared with zero for initialization. There was no retry, model selection or promotion. The [tracked result and lineage](../evidence/native_geometric_shared_core_973.json) bind exact source/compiler/binary, data, controls, artifact and sealed reports.

Candidate `blake3:5979f2e226d34f12aae17ff3a33d0fddfa253d855af4f9754460eaf428cd925d` is preserved as negative evidence in `shared-core-first-step/experiment-1/candidate.json` under the handoff below; initialized parent is `blake3:8946180617a152f381f87c5949582646ea1662cf2dc2dff6822242750320df45`. Release builds and seven focused tests pass, covering causality/checkpoint replay, finite byte/EOS and ring bounds, artifact validation, context removal, the joint objective and the integer-kernel source guard. A separate 512-step observe/predict allocation census passes with zero allocations. These establish scoped implementation properties, not a matrix-free or energy qualification of the inherited complete serving path.

The original `/Users/casey.allard/uor-r4-worktrees/initial-previous-intent` worktree and its dirty `codex/memory-completion` branch remain preserved. Local notes and navigation stay in its established `.uor-handoff/2026-09-12-codex-v7/` directory, reached through the matching symlink in the new worktree. The active local attempt is `shared-core-first-step/`; its `projection.json` allocates 1,200,000 ms model work, 600,000 ms engineering and 2 GiB new storage within existing cumulative limits, with no extension or paid compute. It also pins input/context, fit, RAM/thread and stop-margin limits. The shared cumulative ledger remains `/Users/casey.allard/uor-r4/.uor-models/native-joint-learning-2026-09-04/model-time.json`; refresh actual charges rather than using older snapshots below.

Executed resource receipt: 248,780 ms model/build/test work of 1,200,000 ms; 18,315 ms metered engineering commands; cumulative model ledger 119,999,353 / 132,950,000 ms. Storage growth at execution close is 1,260,466,176 bytes of 2 GiB, including the preserved full worktree. No allowance extension or paid compute. The exclusive handoff receipt preserves the failed initial compile charge as well as the passing checks.

Retained artifact: `/Users/casey.allard/uor-r4/.uor-models/native-typed-value-2026-09-05/reader-scope-repair/model.json`, CID `blake3:15baec48bed905348d5ccf8ff0c53ff84673b0cd82976785f39ced42ef14cb78`, SHA256 `1454aa69e2e295d0a9970e90326f4664d3c614f666b1a708a16c16b5350a1705`. Original repair artifacts and sealed evidence remain at `/Users/casey.allard/Documents/Codex/2026-09-11/uor-r4-codex-memory-repair`; no rollback, cleanup or artifact relocation is part of plan adoption.

**Diagnostic completed without refitting:** the [byte-emission diagnosis](../native_geometric_shared_core_diagnostic_973.md) and [exact evidence](../evidence/native_geometric_shared_core_diagnostic_973.json) reproduce all four original initial/candidate construction/holdout metric sets. The candidate's first branch makes 206/672 construction errors; the best permitted landmark on those frozen states still makes 189. The next ASCII branch's landmark is already optimal and still makes 292/660 errors, with equal composed codes forcing at least 168 errors. Four-root state equality after input forces only 6/660 construction errors and none on the 245 held-out positions; that narrow distinction does not establish semantic quality. Replacing greedy traversal with complete leaf-probability mode only changes candidate byte accuracy 25 → 33/672 and 0 → 2/249. The restricted emission interface is a demonstrated bottleneck; recurrent/contextual learning remains unqualified. Three focused diagnostic checks and the actual saved-artifact diagnostic pass. Runtime/training source and original artifact/report bytes remain unchanged.

Diagnostic resources: 175,910 / 240,000 ms model/build/test charge, including the reviewed guard correction and both release builds. Parent shared-core cycle total 424,690 / 1,200,000 ms; cumulative ledger 120,175,263 / 132,950,000 ms. Conservative additional storage 17,723,392 bytes within the diagnostic's 256 MiB and original cycle's 2 GiB. No fit, extension or paid compute. Exact source/compiler/binary, all branch traces and sealed reports stay in `shared-core-first-step/diagnostic-1/` under the established handoff.

**Calibrated operator implemented; actual gate `FAIL_CALIBRATION_DOSE_NO_JOINT_FIT`.** The [schema-2 implementation/result](../native_geometric_calibrated_emission_973.md) retains two ordered H4 components through separate signed angular comparisons with learned integer thresholds, then a learned min/max choice. Serving adds no contraction, complete-state Cartesian lookup or inherited predictor. The original artifact round-trips exactly and reproduces its saved metrics. Upgrade `331a9ef1` and calibrated `968cf841` remain separate negative artifacts. Exactly three coordinate calibration passes on 672 construction positions change upgrade NLL 5.612466 → 3.473156 and correct byte/EOS predictions 4 → 65 (legacy: 25). Root errors 12/672 meet the predeclared condition; ASCII errors 220/660 fail the required fewer than 216. Joint fit, the newly frozen holdout and new generation are **NOT_RUN**. Retained `15baec48` is unchanged.

The read-only exact hard-decision audit finds minima of 10/672 root and 202/660 ASCII errors over this legal class on the same fixed states. No witness was installed or candidate selected. The 202-error witness has worse branch NLL sum (422.567973) than calibration (414.318812); hard-pattern equivalence does not imply equal likelihood. The class can express the gate's decisions, but the audit does not prove a lower-loss calibration was missed or establish fresh transfer. Fourteen shared-core tests, one separate bitset/padding test, the actual saved-artifact audit and two 512-step zero-allocation censuses pass. Exact [evidence and lineage](../evidence/native_geometric_calibrated_emission_973.json) and the exclusive `shared-core-first-step/calibrated-emission-1/` attempts preserve the failed gate and all earlier reports.

Calibration-step resource receipt: 287,467 / 600,000 ms model/build/test work; parent cycle 712,157 / 1,200,000 ms; cumulative ledger 120,462,730 / 132,950,000 ms. Conservative added storage is 26,107,904 bytes within this step's 256 MiB, with parent growth 1,304,297,472 bytes within 2 GiB. Peak sampled process-tree RSS is 2,364,604,416 bytes within 4 GiB. The read-only audit reused unused joint-fit allocation without increasing the cap. One three-pass calibration, no joint fit, extension, paid compute or destructive cleanup. Final engineering and delivery receipts append locally.

The saved-state comparison requested at this checkpoint is completed in the latest step above. The original failed attempt remains sealed. General language, reasoning/coding, matrix-free qualification of the inherited full serving path and laptop energy savings remain unestablished. #973 and #964 remain open; #1139 retains its separate contextual contribution obligation.

All sections below are historical checkpoints. Their dated “next” actions and whole-path serving wording do not override the current plan or establish a matrix-free audit of the inherited additive decoder.

## Reader turn scope and feature capacity: the reader-turn-window contract — bounded positive, September 11

**Retain `15baec48`; `f3620cb7` is preserved as a measured candidate with a disclosed cross-turn regression, `4568679d` remains the preceding fully qualified artifact and `fc479376` the one before it.** The [reader turn-scope and capacity record](../native_geometric_reader_scope_repair_973.md) and its [evidence](../evidence/native_geometric_reader_scope_repair_973.json) supersede the pointer below; the [current-request form record](../native_geometric_current_form_repair_973.md) carries an appended qualification correction. The fifth independent review found that `f3620cb7`'s sixteen-word owner scan, bounded only by the committed-fact cutoff, let a previous turn's question and generated answer name the owner for the next turn (after `... Where is nemvi? Name the owner first. Answer:`, `Where is zalfe? Answer:` returned ` cedar quay.` and `Where is polru? Answer:` returned ` cedar quay.`; 56 of 144 actual follow-ups previously correct went wrong), and that sixteen owner matches in one request panicked because the feature buffer held 64 of the 66 possible features. The repair scopes the scan to the current turn's request words after facts committed within that turn (token boundary plus byte cutoff; an out-of-scope neighbour contributes no context), derives the capacity from the true maximum, and versions the semantics as `reader_turn_window` promoted onto `f3620cb7` without a refit; withholding only the turn boundary reproduces the leak in the artifact test. Serving retains bounded integer/table geometry with no matrix products, transformer, provider, response templates or expert networks.

Fifth review's 677 scored prompts: actual two-turn follow-ups **132/144** for the candidate against 70 (`f3620cb7`) and 106 (`4568679d`, `fc479376`); all 56 regressed rows recover; explicit owner-first emission 72/72, single-request controls 120/144, prior groups unchanged; no row correct-to-wrong against any of the three artifacts and no property degraded on the 72, 76 and 96 changed rows. The sixteen-match flood that panicked completes and equals `4568679d`. Construction-4b (2,904 targets: 930 initial + 234 previous + 1,160 current + 580 abstention including 400 absent-owner): **2,708/2,904** against 2,602 (`f3620cb7`) and 2,362 (`4568679d`); every one of the 196 failing rows also fails on both priors and is named with its inherited reason; one row loses EOS relative to `f3620cb7` because that artifact's leak happened to terminate (its answer equals `4568679d`'s). Preservation 3,386/3,386; removal reproduces the parent on all 2,904; matched histories 12/12 with exact sources; handoff-fresh 764/764; early actual-artifact test with 14 two-turn scope sequences and the flood under four controls; identical to `f3620cb7` on every earlier population and the first four reviews. Independent draw (`dplqx`, `wlaey`, `lbuyh`): **2,708/2,904**, preservation 974/974, the same inherited negatives, no degraded property against `4568679d`. API 3,044/3,045 on each population with the single failure a declared inherited row; 72/216/764 retained comparisons, fourteen older reports, word/Rust, Copy/Add, action, generated Rust and the zero-allocation census pass.

Recorded, not credited: absent-owner requests on reverse-form records (the frozen parent emits a malformed copy; 160 of 1,080 turn-scope rows and 20 of 120 controls, plus the review's 24 single and 10 follow-up rows, on every artifact); absent owner after a plain first turn on forward facts (16 rows; a later dispatch stage copies the previous answer); 16 same/competitor rows the frozen dispatch answers from the previous explanatory question or the first record after a repeated fact; the four wrong-occurrence rows; the eight owner-first bare-value rows on head chains.

**Next: intermediate-version intent with exact depth labels**, defining head-relative record depth against root-relative ordinal before labeling; previous stays one record hop; unknown or evicted targets never become the nearest survivor. Limits: previous-distinct-value intent is not implemented; the eight owner-first bare-value rows on head chains and the absent-owner requests on reverse-form records are open inherited limitations; all five reviews' prompt sets are development evidence and only the fresh draw is held out; bounded authored forms with fresh spellings. General prose, reasoning/program synthesis and alpha/frontier capability remain unfinished. #973 remains open; #1139 retains its separate writer-context contribution obligation.

## Current-request form repair: the reader-request-window contract — bounded positive, September 11

**Retain `f3620cb7`; `4568679d` remains the preceding accepted artifact and `fc479376` the one before it.** The [current-request form repair record](../native_geometric_current_form_repair_973.md) and its [evidence](../evidence/native_geometric_current_form_repair_973.json) supersede the pointer below; the [minimal repeated-head record](../native_geometric_minimal_head_973.md) carries an appended qualification correction. The fourth independent review confirmed the minimal-chain previous-record repair and found that four reverse-form current answers of `4568679d` had lost properties `fc479376` still had (complete value, relation anchor, EOS) while both were wrong, and that the unlabeled explanatory rows had counted parent equality as preservation. The first divergent decision is the frozen persistent relation reader: its owner scan covered only the eight most recent request words, so `Where is pemru? Explain in a sentence. Name the owner first. Answer:` (twelve words, owner ninth) produced no relation candidate and the dispatch fell back to a mis-spanned occurrence copy. The repair is a versioned reader-request-window contract on the shared reader (scan the request words after the latest committed fact, up to sixteen), promoted onto `4568679d` without a refit; every later learner's inherited eight-word feature base, the extent operator, field composition, emitters, codes and dictionaries are unchanged. An unscoped sixteen-word variant (`52fc916b`) was rejected at the stop gate because it answered absent or competing owners from another record on 15 retained rows. Serving retains bounded integer/table geometry with no matrix products, transformer, provider, response templates or expert networks.

Fourth review's 413 scored prompts: **381** for the candidate against 357 (`4568679d`) and 337 (`fc479376`), explicit owner-first emission **72/72**, no row correct-to-wrong against either, and on every one of the 24 changed rows acceptance, complete value, expected record and exact head source improve with EOS restored where it was lost and no property degraded. Construction-3 (1,704 targets: 930 initial + 234 previous + 360 current + 180 abstain): **1,700/1,704** against 1,644 for `4568679d`, the typed current family **236/240** against 180, preservation 3,386/3,386, complete removal reproducing the parent on all 1,704; matched histories 12/12 with exact sources; handoff-fresh 764/764; the early actual-artifact test with 8 new reader-window sequences and 104 disabled-parent turns; identical to `4568679d` row by row on every earlier population except the four repaired reverse-form rows. Independent draw (`xtpxf`, `vtzkh`, `ccgzz`): **1,700/1,704**, preservation 974/974, 56 changed rows against `4568679d` all improved and none degraded. 3,408 + 3,408 API inputs, 72/216/764 retained comparisons, fourteen older reports, word/Rust, Copy/Add, action, generated Rust and the zero-allocation census pass.

Recorded, not credited: the eight owner-first bare-value rows on head chains (unchanged on all three artifacts, a different seam within the eight-word window); four second-turn plain requests after a repeated fact that read another occurrence of the same spelling (text-correct, not selected, identical on both artifacts); reads through the committed relation source are 112 of 236 selected current rows, the rest through the recent capture of the head's own occurrence, reported separately.

**Next: intermediate-version intent with exact depth labels**, defining head-relative record depth against root-relative ordinal before labeling; previous stays one record hop; unknown or evicted targets never become the nearest survivor. Limits: previous-distinct-value intent is not implemented; the eight owner-first bare-value rows on head chains remain an open inherited emission limitation; all four reviews' prompt sets are development evidence and only the fresh draw is held out; bounded authored forms with fresh spellings. General prose, reasoning/program synthesis and alpha/frontier capability remain unfinished. #973 remains open; #1139 retains its separate writer-context contribution obligation.

## Minimal repeated-head chains: previous-record selection through the head hop — bounded positive, September 10

**Retain `4568679d`; `fc479376` remains the prior accepted comparison baseline.** The [minimal repeated-head record](../native_geometric_minimal_head_973.md) and its [evidence](../evidence/native_geometric_minimal_head_973.json) supersede the pointer below. The third independent review verified PRs #1224 and #1225 and found one inherited selection gap: `Record: nelqi in opal harbor. nelqi in opal harbor. What was the previous location of nelqi? Answer:` answered a malformed `Unknown` on every prior artifact although record 1 was present and offered at depth one under chain class seven; the construction had never crossed the two-record identical-assertion chain with the previous intent. The repair is construction coverage through the existing learner (identical-assertion families with competing owners, styles, the ring boundary and follow-ups) and a refit from frozen parent `f0901dad`; no class, parser or answer rule was added. Serving retains bounded integer/table geometry with no matrix products, transformer, provider, response templates or expert networks.

Construction passes **1,464/1,464 targets** in the disjoint typed partition 930 initial + **234 previous** + 120 current + 180 abstain (follow-ups 210 and previous-record rows 168 are overlapping categories), preserving **3,427/3,427** inherited comparisons; exact authored text alone is 1,312/1,464. Complete removal reproduces the parent on every target; withholding the head hop leaves exactly the 1,040 targets that do not need it; withholding the interior reassertion links leaves 1,206; withholding the abstention candidate returns the parent on 174 of 180 abstention rows; immediate-previous-only admission answers none of the 678 deeper root targets; the isolated transform control leaves the parent's 366; removing the committed request scope preserves only 2,710/3,427. Before the repair, `fc479376` passes 1,422/1,464 of the same targets, failing exactly the 42 two-record previous requests (28 `Unknown`, 14 right value through the wrong record or tense). A first candidate `ec79c303` passed the construction but moved two matched-history turns' source from the live head to the root with unchanged text; it is rejected and preserved, and 36 inherit-labeled explanatory current rows on the repeated chain were added before the refit, restoring 12/12 histories. The early actual-checkpoint artifact test covers 24 sequences and both contracts. The independent draw (`angmv`, `ikurj`, `czmfx`) passes 1,464/1,464 targets and 1,010/1,010 preservation rows. Row by row against `fc479376` the candidate is identical on every earlier population and the first two reviews' prompts; the third review differs only on the four repeated-head previous rows (213/221 against 209, no correct-to-wrong); the fresh draw differs on 58 rows: 46 repaired previous requests and 12 owner-first explanatory current rows (8 restored to the parent's accepted present-tense sentence, 4 in the `Record:` form failing on both artifacts).

2,928 construction-derived and 2,928 fresh-derived API inputs preserved; 72/72 query-owner, 216/216 historical-transfer and 764/764 handoff-fresh comparisons exact; fourteen older reports with zero checked differences; 12/12 histories with retained source identities; 24/24 word/Rust; Copy/Add and action 24/24 ordinary and stress; generated Rust compiles and executes; the actual-artifact identity test and the zero-allocation census pass on the candidate. This is not HTTP/browser serving. Full-suite, new-artifact HTTP/browser/WASM and complete-path energy are NOT_RUN.

The review's eight owner-first current requests on head chains still return the correct bare value without naming the owner on every artifact; they are recorded as failures under the typed oracle, not credited, and left to a separate cycle on the emission/instruction seam. Process corrections: the word/Rust `identity` report is reserved before model load and covered by the real-driver check; every newly generated abstention target carries its typed accepted list; target subcounts are a disjoint intent partition; the safeguards cycle's engineering total is corrected by a closure note (335,878 ms) without touching the model ledger.

**Next: intermediate-version intent with exact depth labels**, so a request for a specific earlier version selects that exact record or abstains when the chain no longer holds it, preserving initial, previous and current behavior, reassertions and reassertion heads, identical-assertion chains, competing owners, dependency abstention and causal follow-ups. Limits: previous-distinct-value intent is not implemented; owner-first current-request formatting on head chains is an open inherited limitation (the `Record: {v} holds {o}.` owner-first explanatory form is malformed and the plain form abstains on every artifact); plain-style requests under two phrasings receive the inherited owner sentence; all three reviews' prompts are development evidence and only the fresh draw is held out; bounded authored forms with fresh spellings. General prose, reasoning/program synthesis and alpha/frontier capability remain unfinished. #973 remains open; #1139 retains its separate writer-context contribution obligation.

## Live-head same-value reassertion: the head contract — bounded positive, September 10

**Retain `fc479376`; `90ebd843` remains the prior accepted comparison baseline.** The [head-contract record](../native_geometric_head_reassertion_973.md) and its [evidence](../evidence/native_geometric_head_reassertion_973.json) supersede the pointer below. The second independent review confirmed the disclosed gap: `vemqi in moss harbor. vemqi now in pearl meadow. vemqi in pearl meadow.` answered `Unknown.` for initial and previous requests on every prior artifact, because the frozen immediate-previous reader takes its first hop only below a revised head. The versioned chain contract gains a head contract (`reassertion_heads`): the first hop below a live head that is itself a resident same-value reassertion is valid and re-proven byte for byte; record-hop semantics are stated explicitly (previous is the head's immediate previous record, `pearl meadow`; initial is the root, `moss harbor`); candidates through the head hop carry their own chain classes, the field anchor records the head hop and restores only under the contract, an ablation control withholds it, and legacy artifacts keep their exact wire form and behavior. Serving retains bounded integer/table geometry with no matrix products, transformer, provider, response templates or expert networks.

Construction passes **1,250/1,250 targets**: 822 exact root answers and selections, **96/96 previous-record targets** below reassertion heads, **162/162 abstentions** through actual no-read decisions and **182/182 multi-turn follow-ups**, preserving **3,351/3,351** inherited comparisons; exact authored text alone is 1,116/1,250. Complete removal reproduces the parent on every target; withholding only the head hop leaves exactly the 1,012 targets that do not need it; withholding the interior reassertion links leaves 1,046; withholding the abstention candidate returns the parent on all 162 abstention rows; immediate-previous-only admission answers none of the 630 deeper root targets; the isolated transform control leaves the parent's 338; removing the committed request scope preserves only 2,676/3,351. Before the repair, `90ebd843` passes 1,012/1,250 of the same targets (0/120 head initial, 0/84 previous-record); the flag-only candidate `3688650a` passes 1,020/1,250, so the refit was required. The actual-artifact multi-turn check ran immediately after the construction result (twenty conversations, 72 turns, four head sequences with head anchors restoring only under the contract) before any campaign. Row by row the candidate is identical to `90ebd843` on every prior population except the disclosed head rows (3669, 1252, 794, 890, 3789, 1372 identical; 10 head rows differ in each of 4285 and 1868), answers all 113 scored second-review probes (`90ebd843` 111, `e44a9ae4` 83, `e3a906c8` 83) with no correct-to-wrong change, and is identical to `90ebd843` on the first review's prompts. The separately frozen fresh draw passes **1,250/1,250 targets (822 root answers, 96/96 previous-record targets, 162/162 abstentions, 182/182 follow-ups) and 934/934 preservation cases, with complete removal reproducing the parent on all 1,250**; exact authored text alone is 1,116/1,250, the head-hop ablation leaves 1,012, and removing the committed scope preserves only 573/934; every row differing from `90ebd843` (274) is a declared head-reassertion, previous-record, head-boundary or head follow-up row.

All **5,000 native API checks** pass: 2,500 construction and 2,500 fresh completion/checkpoint-independent-sum checks through the actual Rust native API, including every previous-record target, abstention and follow-up replayed through the same API session, with the typed accepted lists authored at preparation and written into exclusively claimed sibling attempts bound to the source case files. All 72 query-owner, 216 historical-transfer and 764 handoff-fresh comparisons are exact. All fourteen older behavior/control reports have zero checked differences, including their negative interventions. Twelve multi-turn histories replay with identical outputs, records, versions and sources, 24 word/Rust cases are preserved, Copy/Add and action each pass 24/24 ordinary and 24/24 stress cases on the new artifact, and actual generated Rust is compiled and executed. Focused verification passes **38 checks** on `fc479376`: nine chain-traversal tests (reassertion link, eviction proof, head hop), three version-intent format tests (chain classes one to ten, contract flags, follow-up documents), nineteen field-composition, historical-field, handoff, query-context and role-read tests, two report-directory and two answer-oracle tests, the native integer-kernel source guard, the actual-artifact test and the allocation census. The artifact test executes twenty conversations over 72 turns, checking 7,304 input and 1,644 output checkpoint positions and 56 active anchors: eight mixed-length conversations, two evicted-root abstentions, six reassertion sequences, and four head-reassertion sequences whose initial anchors carry the head flag at depths two and three, whose previous anchors read the head's previous record through the head hop, which restore only under the head contract and reject a head that no longer repeats its predecessor's value, and for which withholding the head hop returns exactly the parent's own answer and never the root. The allocation census records zero allocations and zero bytes across 1,284 input and 182 output positions including the head-hop initial and previous cases; it is a census of observe/predict, not an energy measurement. This is not HTTP/browser serving. Full-suite, new-artifact HTTP/browser/WASM and complete-path energy are NOT_RUN.

**Next: intermediate-version intent with exact depth labels**, so a request for a specific earlier version selects that exact record or abstains when the chain no longer holds it, preserving initial, previous and current behavior, reassertions and reassertion heads, competing owners, dependency abstention and causal follow-ups. Limits: previous-distinct-value intent is not implemented; a previous request on a revised head whose previous record was evicted keeps the parent's answer; plain-style requests under two phrasings receive the inherited owner sentence; both reviews' prompts are development evidence and only the fresh draw is held out; bounded authored forms with fresh spellings. General prose, reasoning/program synthesis and alpha/frontier capability remain unfinished. #973 remains open; #1139 retains its separate writer-context contribution obligation.

## Reassertion-versus-truncation repair of the version-intent chain contract — bounded positive, September 10

**Retain `90ebd843`; `e44a9ae4` is superseded and preserved as regression evidence.** The [repair record](../native_geometric_reassertion_chain_repair_973.md), its [evidence](../evidence/native_geometric_reassertion_chain_repair_973.json) and the first cycle's [erratum](../evidence/native_geometric_historical_version_973_erratum.json) supersede the two pointers below. The independent review of PRs #1221/#1222 reproduced four correct-to-wrong answers in `e44a9ae4`: a resident nonconflicting same-value reassertion was mistaken for a truncated history, so `Record: selvi in Dusk Ridge. selvi in Dusk Ridge. selvi now in Copper Vale. What was the initial location of selvi? Answer:` answered `Unknown.` instead of `Dusk Ridge.`. The chain contract is now versioned in the witness (`reassertion_links`): a validated link is an explicit revision or a resident same-owner, same-value, nonconflicting reassertion re-proven byte for byte, and a chain is truncated only when the next predecessor is proven evicted from the ring; a rejected link is not absence. The same contract is carried through selection, the field-anchor proof, emission and checkpoint restore. Legacy artifacts keep their exact wire form and behavior. Serving retains bounded integer/table geometry with no matrix products, transformer, provider, response templates or expert networks.

Construction passes **976/976 targets**: 690 exact root answers and selections at depths one to three, **132/132 abstentions** through actual no-read decisions and **154/154 multi-turn follow-ups** (previous/current requests after one or two earlier turns answered by the model itself keep the exact immediate-previous or current record), preserving **3,309/3,309** inherited comparisons; exact authored text alone is 864/976. Complete removal reproduces the parent on every target; withholding only the reassertion links and eviction proof leaves exactly the 820 targets that need neither; withholding the abstention candidate returns the parent on 116 abstention rows; immediate-previous-only admission answers none of the 498 deeper root targets; the isolated transform control leaves the parent's 302; removing the committed request scope preserves only 3,050/3,309. Before the repair, `e44a9ae4` passes 806/976 of the same targets (0/144 reassertion-link targets, all answering `Unknown.`; 144/154 follow-ups). The flag-only diagnostic candidate `6e8901a7` passes 818/822 single-turn targets and all 50 scored review prompts, which established that a refit was needed only for four boundary abstentions; the first refit `d9712bfe` passed every single-turn gate and an independent draw and was rejected by the focused actual-artifact test for anchoring an ancestor on multi-turn follow-ups, which is why follow-up documents were added and the design reopened. The retained candidate answers all 50 scored review prompts (`f0901dad` 37, `e3a906c8` 42, `e44a9ae4` 42) with no correct-to-wrong change, is identical to `e44a9ae4` on every row of every prior population (3669, 1252, 794, 890, 3789, 1372) and differs from `e3a906c8` only on the declared evicted-root abstentions. The separately frozen second fresh draw (the first, for the rejected refit, is preserved) passes **976/976 targets (690 exact root answers and selections, 132/132 abstentions, 154/154 follow-ups) and 892/892 preservation cases, with complete removal reproducing the parent on all 976**; exact authored text alone is 864/976, the reassertion-ablation control leaves 820, and removing the committed scope preserves only 738/892; every row differing from `e44a9ae4` (200) or `e3a906c8` (330) is a declared reassertion, follow-up or eviction target.

All **3,904 native API checks** pass: 1,952 construction and 1,952 fresh completion/checkpoint-independent-sum checks through the actual Rust native API, including every abstention and every follow-up replayed through the same API session, with the plain-style owner-sentence alternate declared in the case files before the draw. All 72 query-owner, 216 historical-transfer and 764 handoff-fresh comparisons are exact. All fourteen older behavior/control reports have zero checked differences, including their negative interventions. Twelve multi-turn histories replay with identical outputs, records, versions and sources, 24 word/Rust cases are preserved, Copy/Add and action each pass 24/24 ordinary and 24/24 stress cases on the new artifact, and actual generated Rust is compiled and executed. Focused verification passes **35 checks** on `90ebd843`: eight chain-traversal tests (reassertion link, eviction proof), three version-intent format tests (contract flag, follow-up documents), nineteen field-composition, historical-field, handoff, query-context and role-read tests, two report-directory collision and manifest tests, the native integer-kernel source guard, the actual-artifact test and the allocation census. The artifact test executes sixteen conversations over 56 turns, checking 6,074 input and 1,298 output checkpoint positions and 44 active anchors: two evicted-root abstentions, two reassertion-root and two reassertion-middle sequences whose anchors restore only under the versioned contract and reject a legacy claim or a changed reassertion value, two evicted-reassertion abstentions with the reassertion resident, parent equivalence under complete removal, and no root anchor when the reassertion links are withheld. The allocation census records zero allocations and zero bytes across 1,054 input and 140 output positions including reassertion-path and evicted-root cases; it is a census of observe/predict, not an energy measurement. The same artifact test rejected `d9712bfe`; the first focused chain of this cycle failed to spawn its unit tests (five zero-length rows, charged) and was rerun. This is not HTTP/browser serving. Full-suite, new-artifact HTTP/browser/WASM and complete-path energy are NOT_RUN.

Evidence preservation: every driver used now creates its report directory exclusively and seals completed attempts with a BLAKE3 manifest; the first cycle's claim that the rejected `d6144304` older reports survive in command logs was inaccurate and is corrected by erratum (the reports were overwritten in place; survivors are listed; nothing was reconstructed). Two counts are corrected there as well. A second independent review verified the repair with new generations (50/50 original prompts, 60/60 new probes, no correct-to-wrong change) and its four safeguard corrections are delivered in the [follow-up section](../native_geometric_reassertion_chain_repair_973.md#follow-up-corrections-after-the-independent-review-of-pr-1223): destinations reserved before model loading at every caller with a real-driver check, derived API inputs kept out of sealed roots with a complete-file-set verifier, a typed frozen answer oracle shared by both evaluators (a previous request never accepts a present-tense old value), and a wrapper with one idempotent charge per command plus the 22 ms reconciliation. The next model task is the disclosed live-head same-value reassertion gap (`o in a. o now in b. o in b.` still answers `Unknown.` for initial and previous requests), before intermediate-version intent.

**Next: intermediate-version intent with exact depth labels**, now that the repair is qualified: a request for a specific earlier version selects that exact record or abstains when the chain no longer holds it, preserving initial, previous and current behavior, reassertions, competing owners, dependency abstention and causal follow-ups. Limits: abstention after a reassertion chain loses its root is by exact-record identity, not value recovery; a head that is itself a same-value reassertion has no historical read; plain-style requests under two phrasings receive the inherited owner sentence; the review prompts became development evidence and only the fresh draw is held out; these are bounded authored forms with fresh spellings. General prose, reasoning/program synthesis and alpha/frontier capability remain unfinished. #973 remains open; #1139 retains its separate writer-context contribution obligation.

## Learned abstention for truncated histories — bounded positive, September 10

**Retain `e44a9ae4`.** The [abstention result](../native_geometric_truncated_history_abstention_973.md) and [evidence](../evidence/native_geometric_truncated_history_abstention_973.json) supersede the pointer below. The version-intent witness gains a versioned abstention option: a request-named revised chain whose validated links reach no genuine root is offered to the same learned selector as a truncated candidate competing for the parent's no-read action, so an initial-version request whose root was evicted from the sixteen-slot ring answers `Unknown.` instead of the oldest survivor. Complete chains, the ancestor path proof, owner-role masking, the per-view dictionary and every inner parameter are unchanged; legacy artifacts keep their exact wire form and never abstain. The successor is refit from frozen parent `f0901dad` over the extended construction and reproduces retained `e3a906c8` on every prior row outside the declared evicted-root repair targets. Serving retains bounded integer/table geometry with no matrix products, transformer, provider, response templates or expert networks.

Construction passes **594/594 targets**: 486 exact root answers and selections and **108/108 abstentions** through actual no-read decisions, preserving **3,195/3,195** inherited comparisons. Exact authored text alone is 516/594, the rest being the inherited owner sentence for the same record. Complete removal reproduces the parent on every target; withholding only the truncated candidate returns the parent's answer on 84 abstention rows and the surviving previous version on 24; immediate-previous-only admission answers none of the 318 deeper targets; the isolated transform control leaves the parent's 124; removing the committed request scope preserves only 2,935/3,195 cases. Against `e3a906c8`, outputs are identical on 3621/3669 construction-4 rows, 746/794 first-draw rows, 842/890 second-draw rows and 1204/1252 third-draw rows; every differing row is a declared evicted-root initial request that now answers `Unknown.` instead of the surviving previous value. The separately frozen fresh draw passes **594/594 targets (486 exact root answers and selections, 108/108 abstentions through no-read decisions) and 778/778 preservation cases, with complete removal reproducing the parent on all 594; exact authored text alone is 516/594, withholding the truncated candidate returns the parent on 84 abstention rows, and removing the committed scope preserves only 636/778**.

All 72 query-owner, 216 historical-transfer and 764 handoff-fresh comparisons are exact. All fourteen older behavior/control reports have zero checked differences, including their negative interventions. Twelve multi-turn histories replay with identical outputs, records, versions and sources, and 24 word/Rust cases are preserved. Copy/Add and action each pass 24/24 ordinary and 24/24 stress cases on the new artifact, and actual generated Rust is compiled and executed. Focused verification passes **31 checks** on `e44a9ae4`: six ancestor-admission tests, three version-intent format tests including the fifth structural class bound, nineteen field-composition, historical-field, handoff, query-context and role-read tests, the native integer-kernel source guard, the actual-artifact test and the allocation census. The artifact test executes ten conversations over mixed-length competing chains and one evicted-root sequence, checking 3,861 input and 826 output checkpoint positions, 28 active anchors, two evicted-root abstentions that the abstain-disabled control does not produce, and parent equivalence under complete removal across 40 turns. The allocation census records zero allocations and zero bytes across 805 input and 99 output positions, including one evicted-root abstention; it is a census of observe/predict, not an energy measurement. The first focused chain failed on a stale class-bound assertion in the version-intent format test, was corrected and rerun, and both runs are charged. All **2,376 native API checks** pass: 1,188 construction and 1,188 fresh completion/checkpoint-independent-sum checks, including every abstention, through the actual Rust native API. This is not HTTP/browser serving. Full-suite, new-artifact HTTP/browser/WASM and complete-path energy are NOT_RUN.

**Next: intermediate-version intent with exact depth labels.** A request for a specific earlier version, such as the second of four, is neither labeled nor claimed; the selector must pick that exact record or abstain when the chain no longer holds it, while preserving initial, previous and current behavior, competing owners, dependency abstention and causal follow-ups. A conflicted head and a single-record chain are not truncations. The committed request boundary is not general request segmentation; these are bounded authored forms with fresh spellings. General prose, reasoning/program synthesis and alpha/frontier capability remain unfinished. #973 remains open; #1139 retains its separate writer-context contribution obligation.

## Learned initial-versus-previous version intent — bounded positive, September 10

**Retain `e3a906c8`.** The [historical version result](../native_geometric_historical_version_973.md) and [evidence](../evidence/native_geometric_historical_version_973.json) supersede the pointer below. An optional outer witness walks each request-named live head's validated revision chain to its genuine assertion root, offers every exact ancestor with its depth and chain class, and lets a shared signed-H4 selector choose an ancestor or defer to the unchanged parent. The selector's vocabulary comes from its own committed request views, with identities only for words recurring in construction; the queried owner and any competing owner enter as role sentinels, not spellings. The field anchor carries an explicit ancestor depth, and every dependent read and checkpoint restore revalidates the complete path. The complete `f0901dad` parent, its frozen immediate-previous reader, stored records, dictionaries and geometry remain frozen. Serving retains bounded integer/table geometry with no matrix products, transformer, provider, response templates or expert networks.

Construction passes **474/474 exact initial answers and root selections** at depths one, two and three, preserving **3,195/3,195** inherited comparisons including evicted-root deferrals, re-asserted chains and mixed-length competing chains. Two earlier selections are **rejected** and preserved: `f0eb0e4a` regressed 32 plain absent-owner requests with fresh spellings on its independent draw, and `d6144304` passed its independent draw but regressed 72 handoff-fresh rows, six matched histories and a mixed-length artifact sequence. Each rejection explicitly reopened development and turned its draw into open evidence. The retained design passes both opened draws (402/402 with 392/392 and 488/488), the twelve histories and the 764-row handoff population before selection, and the separately frozen third draw at **474/474 targets and 778/778 preservation cases**. Plain-style targets under two phrasings receive the parent emitter's inherited owner sentence for the same exact record; exact authored text alone is 398/474, reported separately. Complete removal reproduces the parent on every target; immediate-previous-only admission answers none of the 306 deeper targets; the isolated transform control leaves the parent's 108; removing the committed request scope preserves only 2,980/3,195 and 648/778 cases.

All 72 query-owner, 216 historical-transfer and 764 handoff-fresh comparisons are exact. All fourteen older behavior/control reports have zero checked differences, including their negative interventions. Twelve multi-turn histories replay with identical outputs, records, versions and sources, and 24 word/Rust cases are preserved. Copy/Add and action each pass 24/24 ordinary and 24/24 stress cases, and actual generated Rust is compiled and executed. Thirty-one focused checks pass, including the actual-artifact test over mixed-length chains (2,884 input and 698 output checkpoint positions, 24 corrupted-path rejections, 32 disabled-parent turns) and a zero-allocation census; 1,896 native API checks pass. Full-suite, new-artifact HTTP/browser/WASM and complete-path energy are NOT_RUN.

**Next: learn abstention when a validated chain cannot supply the requested version, then intermediate-version intent.** A root evicted from the sixteen-slot ring yields no root candidate today; the selector defers and the parent's previous-value answer is emitted rather than an abstention. Requests for a specific intermediate version are neither labeled nor claimed. The committed request boundary is not general request segmentation, and these are bounded authored forms with fresh spellings. General prose, reasoning/program synthesis and alpha/frontier capability remain unfinished. #973 remains open; #1139 retains its separate writer-context contribution obligation.

Accounted storage is 44,989,382,656 / 46,674,374,656 bytes, leaving 1,550,774,272 bytes after the 128 MiB margin. No unique deletion or paid external compute occurred. Final documentation and protected-delivery charges append to the mutable receipt without resetting prior charges.

## Contextual current-record handoff — bounded positive, September 9

**Retain `f0901dad`.** The [current-query handoff result](../native_geometric_current_query_handoff_973.md) and [evidence](../evidence/native_geometric_current_query_handoff_973.json) supersede the pointer below. A shared signed-H4 selector now accepts the frozen current reader's exact candidate before dependent/recent dispatch, or defers to the unchanged parent. Its automatically constructed lexical-prime dictionary and source-occurrence context distinguish current requests from literal words inside facts. Historical selection stays first. The complete `84f82191` parent, stored owner/version identities, geometric parameters and copy/field emission remain frozen. Serving retains bounded integer/table geometry with no matrix products, transformer, provider, response templates or expert networks.

Two candidates remain rejected: `540dfa71` passed its initial construction but broke sixteen dependency contrasts; `6816176b` passed the complete construction but failed two fresh targets and regressed four factual-word cases. The same-data inherited-dictionary control `fef57f97` answers only 138/208 targets. All artifacts, failures and charges are preserved. After the lexical candidate's fresh rejection, development was explicitly reopened; its draw remains open evidence for the successor, and the successor's final draw was independent.

The retained successor passes **208/208 construction targets and 2,292/2,292 preservation cases**, then **196/196 targets and 568/568 preservation cases** on both the opened prior draw and its separately frozen independent fresh draw. All thirty-two dependency, four absent-owner and sixteen literal-word contrasts in the final fresh population are semantically correct. The scope-removal control keeps current targets correct but breaks sixteen role cases in construction and fresh evaluation; the isolated geometric-transform control answers zero fresh targets, and complete removal reproduces the parent on all 196. These are bounded authored forms with fresh spellings.

All 72 query-owner and 216 historical-transfer comparisons are exact. Fourteen older reports have zero checked differences; twelve histories and 24 word/Rust cases are preserved. Copy/Add and action each pass 24 ordinary and 24 stress cases, with generated Rust compiled and executed. All 12 focused checks and 808 native API checks pass. The actual-artifact test checks eight current→historical→arithmetic conversations, 2,064 input and 476 output checkpoint positions, 48 malformed-restore rejections and 24 disabled-parent turn comparisons. Rejected artifact bytes and wrong outputs remain reproducible. Full-suite, new-artifact HTTP/browser/WASM, allocation instrumentation and complete-path energy are NOT_RUN.

**Next: contextual initial-versus-previous intent with bounded exact ancestor selection and historical field-path proof.** The eighteen-case three-version diagnostic passes six current and six immediate-previous forms, but all six initial requests emit the immediate previous value. The historical reader maps initial to prime zero and admits only current.previous; a lexical change alone cannot select the unoffered initial record. Preserve complete spans, competing owners, consecutive revisions, current/previous safeguards, dependency abstention and causal arithmetic follow-ups. The current occurrence cutoff is not general request segmentation: uncommitted prose and queries before later facts remain limitations. General prose, reasoning/program synthesis and alpha/frontier capability remain unfinished. #973 remains open; #1139 retains its separate writer-context contribution obligation.

Preserve `84f82191` and every earlier positive/negative artifact. Local evidence: `/Users/casey.allard/Documents/Codex/2026-09-09/uor-r4-current-query-handoff`.

At the immutable evidence snapshot, this cycle used 2636.903 model seconds and 805.356 engineering-command seconds, including rejected candidates and the failed configuration attempt. Cumulative use is 42344.214 / 43650.000 seconds, with 196.620 seconds reserved. The complete projection allows 3,600 model seconds, 1,800 engineering-command seconds, one process/two threads, 4 GiB model/6 GiB build RAM and 1 GiB new storage. Standing-authorized increments of 3,000 seconds and 512 MiB were recorded before use; later refinements use the same allowances. Accounted storage is 40,862,650,368 / 41,305,665,536 bytes, leaving 308,797,440 bytes after the 128 MiB margin. No unique deletion or paid external compute occurred.

## Contextual historical selection — bounded positive, September 9

**Retain `84f82191`.** The [historical-query result](../native_geometric_historical_query_context_973.md) and [evidence](../evidence/native_geometric_historical_query_context_973.json) supersede the pointer below. The existing shared signed-H4 historical router now learns owner-specific context and current-intent deferral over sixteen captured words, while exact owner matching remains bounded to eight. Two final code roots change; exact records, current/previous links, dictionary, landmarks, biases, ranks and all inner parent parameters remain frozen. Serving adds no matrix product, transformer, provider, phrase parser, answer template or expert network.

Construction passes 48/48 exact historical owner/value sentences and version proofs versus parent 0/48, preserving 171/171 inherited cases. Separately frozen fresh transfer passes 64/64 targets versus parent 0/64 and preserves 227/227 inherited comparisons, including both owner orders, both queried owners and a fresh absent owner. No refit or redraw occurred. Four removal/geometry/read interventions score 0/64, and full removal reproduces the parent. Window-only removal retains the historical targets but breaks 16/171 construction preservation cases: long current requests wrongly emit old values. Full preserves their existing Unknown response; this is historical deferral, not correct-current-answer qualification.

All 1,300 retained construction, 72 query-owner and 216 historical-transfer comparisons are exact. Fourteen older behavior/control reports have zero differences; 12 histories and 24 word/Rust cases are preserved. Copy→Add and action each pass 24/24 ordinary and 24/24 stress, and generated Rust compiles and executes. The two prior historical-field panels repair 40/40 older long-query failures while preserving 246/246 other cases. All 44 focused tests and 330 native API checks pass. Actual-artifact validation covers 22 historical→current→arithmetic sequences at 6,461 input and 1,308 output checkpoint positions, 66 malformed-proof rejections and 66 disabled-parent turn comparisons. Full suite, new-artifact browser/WASM/HTTP, allocation instrumentation and complete-path energy remain NOT_RUN.

Preserve exposure-only `0fe078da` (no diagnostic improvement) and rejected `7c33071d` (first-owner shortcut: 4/8 present-owner probes correct and 4/4 absent-owner probes wrongly copied). Earlier single-owner passes did not qualify that candidate. The balanced refit repaired the observed shortcut before the fresh draw.

**Next: contextual current-intent selection across dependent and current-source dispatch.** All six long current requests in the actual diagnostic defer historically, then select a missing dependent link and return Unknown. Name/State dependent copy scores 10 against Base 9; the short current form defers and answers correctly. Existing dependent features distinguish is/was, but their learned mappings do not use that distinction. The diagnostic current reader including recent values selects the correct record, yet default persistent reading defers and counterfactual direct routing selects NoRead in 5/6 cases. Repair the blocked handoff with actual complete generation checks; dependent deferral alone is not a demonstrated answer repair. Preserve genuine dependency reads, missing-link abstention, exact owner/version identity, historical/current follow-ups and arithmetic. Initial-version selection, sustained prose, general reasoning/program synthesis and alpha/frontier capability remain unfinished. #973 stays open.

Artifact: `.uor-models/native-typed-value-2026-09-05/historical-query-context/model.json`, CID `blake3:84f8219164c08fe2ff10de0794af9658075b2ad5ad7723e1aa2b12d40a7a1fe5`, SHA256 `ba5e72409642c6710a8d694b48e63b311c2e63cf6d90b7ae2ed3bd8d2291f3b0`, 15,731,317 bytes. Parent `8cacb2fe` and every earlier positive/negative artifact remain preserved. Local evidence: `/Users/casey.allard/Documents/Codex/2026-09-09/uor-r4-historical-query-context`.

At the immutable evidence snapshot this cycle used 3001.982 model seconds and 770.737 engineering-command seconds; cumulative use is 39707.311 / 40650.000 seconds with 196.620 seconds reserved. The complete pre-use projection is 3,600 model seconds, 1,800 engineering-command seconds, one process/two threads, 4 GiB model/6 GiB build RAM and 1 GiB new storage. Standing-authorized increments were 1,200 seconds and 256 MiB. Accounted storage is 39,912,017,920 / 40,768,794,624 bytes, leaving 722,558,976 after the 128 MiB margin. All prior charges, including corrected build and missing-input API attempts, remain. No unique deletion or paid external compute occurred. Final closure charges append to the mutable receipt.

## Historical owner/value composition — bounded positive, September 9

**Retain `8cacb2fe`.** The [historical-field result](../native_geometric_historical_field_973.md) and [evidence](../evidence/native_geometric_historical_field_973.json) supersede the pointer below. The actual parent selects the correct previous record for before+owner-first requests but emits only its value. The new optional outer witness enables exact owner/value reads from that already-selected old record, with a live current-revision link revalidated through emission and checkpoint replay. Only new type-18 roots are learned in the existing shared signed-H4 lexical router; the current adapter and all inherited parameters remain frozen. Serving adds no response template, phrase parser, transformer, provider, matrix product or expert network.

Construction passes 32/32 historical sentences versus parent 0/32, with exact old/current links and unchanged records; 83/83 inherited comparisons are preserved. Separately frozen fresh transfer passes 48/48 targets versus parent 0/48 and preserves 123/123 inherited cases. Each removal/context/geometry/read intervention scores 0/48; the removal control exactly matches the parent. No refit or redraw occurred. These are fresh spellings in authored forms, not general language qualification.

All 1,300 retained construction, 72 query-owner and 216 historical-transfer output/EOS/decision/relation-state comparisons are exact. All 14 older behavior/control reports have zero checked differences; 12 histories and 24 word/Rust cases are preserved. Copy→Add and action each pass 24/24 ordinary and 24/24 stress; generated Rust compiles and executes. All 39 focused tests and 266 native API checks pass. Actual-artifact verification covers eight historical→current→arithmetic sequences at 1,904 input and 474 output checkpoint positions, 24 malformed active-checkpoint rejections, artifact integrity and disabled-control state equivalence. Full suite, new-artifact browser/WASM/HTTP, allocation instrumentation and complete-path energy remain NOT_RUN.

**Next: trace contextual historical selection for longer previous-location owner-first requests.** These still return Unknown upstream and are explicitly preserved as negative evidence. Source inspection suggests the eight-word historical feature window may omit earlier temporal cues after an instruction suffix; actual cue exposure and candidate scores are not yet traced. Diagnose that representation before a bounded contextual intent/owner-binding repair. Preserve exact version identity, current/history follow-ups, abstention and arithmetic. Initial-versus-immediate-previous selection, sustained prose, general reasoning/program synthesis and alpha/frontier capability remain unfinished. #973 stays open.

The complete pre-use projection is 3,600 model seconds, 1,800 engineering-command seconds, one process/two threads, 4 GiB model/6 GiB build RAM and 1 GiB new storage. Necessary standing-authorized increments were 1,200 seconds and 256 MiB. Accounted storage is 39,349,628,928 / 40,500,359,168 bytes, with 1,016,512,512 bytes after the 128 MiB margin.

## Reverse phrase-start transfer — bounded positive, September 9

**Retain `57cee4c4`.** The [reverse-start result](../native_geometric_reverse_start_transfer_973.md) and [evidence](../evidence/native_geometric_reverse_start_transfer_973.json) supersede the pointer below. Actual traces show the complete lowercase reverse value was admitted but lost 3–4 to its singleton. Two existing H4 code rows now make it win 6–4, preserving the 100-key vocabulary, dictionary, scoring/admission law, geometry, exact endpoints and all other parent parameters. The optional outer witness restores the full historical-reader parent `f76e7452`; its disabled control reproduces that parent. Serving adds no matrix products, transformer, provider, phrase parser or answer templates.

Construction passes 36/36 new answers versus parent 30/36, preserves all 53 historical answers/selections, and retains all 1,264 inherited output/EOS/decision/full-state comparisons. The previous opened negative panel improves from 44/64 to 64/64 complete historical answers with 64/64 selections. Its 28 current/absent responses preserve text, EOS and decisions; 16 intended, source-verified old-span repairs are recorded separately. All other state is exact, and raw complete-state equality remains 36/92 across that panel. Separately frozen fresh transfer passes 216/216 answers versus parent 192/216, all 216 complete old spans and 144/144 historical selections. All 216 removal-control comparisons match the parent, without refit or redraw. These are fresh spellings in authored forms, not general language qualification.

All 14 older behavior/control reports have zero checked differences; 12 histories and the 24-case word/Rust panel are preserved. All 72 query-owner answers/stops/source decisions are exact; 72 intended old-span repairs match original frozen labels/source bytes, with all other state exact and raw complete-state equality 0/72. Copy→Add and action each pass 24/24 ordinary and 24/24 stress; generated Rust compiles and executes. All 33 focused tests and 394 scoped native API checks pass. The actual-artifact test covers eight historical→current→arithmetic sequences at 1,880 input and 264 output checkpoint positions, with artifact integrity and eight disabled-control causal-state comparisons. Full suite, new-artifact browser/WASM/HTTP, allocation instrumentation and complete-path energy remain NOT_RUN.

**Next: version-aware owner/value compositional emission from an explicitly selected historical record, preserving the current-record safeguards.** The compositor currently accepts only current-directory records. Inspect real owner-first historical output, then learn the shared lexical continuation over the exact selected old version. Initial-versus-immediate-previous selection, sustained prose, general reasoning/program synthesis and alpha/frontier capability remain unfinished. #973 stays open.

The complete projection and pre-use authorized increments are recorded in the linked evidence: 3,600 model seconds, 1,800 engineering-command seconds, one process/two threads, 4 GiB model/6 GiB build RAM and 1 GiB new storage; increments were 2,100 seconds and 512 MiB. Accounted storage is 39,059,120,128 / 40,231,923,712 bytes with 1,038,585,856 bytes after the 128 MiB margin. All prior charges remain.

## Historical read and input boundaries — transfer incomplete, September 9

**Retained model remains `4d81c3b0`. Do not promote `f76e7452`.** The [historical-read implementation and result](../native_geometric_historical_selection_973.md) and [evidence](../evidence/native_geometric_historical_selection_973.json) record the completed development cycle. The new optional shared signed-H4 operator selects a live immediate predecessor through exact version links. Artifact-bound scope 2 also prevents old query words from leaking into historical and dependent selectors after an input boundary. This adds no serving phrase parser, answer template, expert network, transformer or matrix-product operation.

Construction passes 53/53 historical answers versus parent 0/53, with all exact previous-record selections and 1,211/1,211 untargeted comparisons preserved. Post-selection fresh transfer selects the exact previous record in 64/64 cases, but only 44/64 answers contain the complete value; the parent answers 0/64 correctly. All 28 untargeted fresh comparisons are preserved, and disabling the new operation restores parent behavior on all 53 construction and 64 fresh targets. The predeclared fresh gate failed; it was not relaxed.

The 20 fresh failures arise before reading: reverse facts such as `eoqn rgoo holds eddwg` leave only `rgoo` in the old record, with no stored span. Candidate and parent writer states are identical. The historical read selects that exact record and emits its stored singleton. Reverse-start ranking is the next source-supported hypothesis; an actual candidate/score trace is still required.

The first candidate, `a3c3093c`, passed single-prompt construction but failed the real current follow-up. Scope-2 candidate `f76e7452` repairs all eight tested historical→current follow-ups with unchanged historical routing parameters, yet fails fresh complete-value transfer. Both artifacts and their distinct negative results are preserved.

All 14 earlier behavior/control reports have zero checked differences. The 12 retained multi-turn histories preserve outputs and applicable record/source identities; the earlier 24-case word/Rust panel and all 72 query-owner cases are preserved. Copy→Add and action emission each pass 24/24 ordinary and 24/24 stress cases. Actual generated Rust outputs compile and execute. The scoped native API passes 106/106 historical-answer and checkpoint/independent-sum checks. All 31 focused tests pass, including eight historical→current→arithmetic sequences with 1,636 input and 274 output checkpoint positions, and byte-exact replay of the rejected legacy artifact's negative behavior. Formatting and the integer-kernel source guard pass. These checks do not override the failed fresh text gate.

**Next under #973: inspect the admitted reverse phrase starts and their geometric scores, then improve the existing reverse-start training for unfamiliar lowercase multiword values if the full candidate is admitted. Balance singleton and introductory-context controls, preserve exact endpoints and all retained behavior, and use a new separately frozen transfer draw. Complete stored-value recovery takes priority over initial-versus-previous selection or historical owner-first emission.** General prose, broad reasoning/program synthesis, alpha/frontier capability and complete-path energy advantage remain unqualified. #973 remains open.

Retained artifact: `.uor-models/native-typed-value-2026-09-05/query-owner/model.json`, CID `blake3:4d81c3b003499648e47248fb8d5d4a50622f6cc0fbad83f0baad2f6cf25b3fac`, SHA256 `f688f842186c64a96d5a12ff9d7a70b6ce133512bf11a550c6eb9453d1b3897c`.

The immutable evidence snapshot records 1943.224 model seconds and 696.050 engineering-command seconds for this cycle, including failed attempts. Cumulative model use is 34174.720 / 36150.000 seconds, with the prior 196.620-second reservation preserved. Before use, the standing authorization supplied a 2,100-second model increment and a 512 MiB storage increment. The complete projection was 3,600 model seconds, 1,800 engineering-command seconds, one model process/two threads, 4 GiB model/6 GiB build RAM and 1 GiB new storage. New inputs use 512 tokens/4,096 bytes and 96 output tokens; inherited population bounds remain 8,192 tokens/65,536 bytes with five-turn histories and 1,056 padding tokens per turn. The retry build projection increased from 400 to 650 seconds within the overall unchanged allowance after observing API dependency rebuilding. Accounted storage is 38741913600 / 39695052800 bytes, leaving 818921472 bytes after the 128 MiB stop margin. No new model was promoted, no unique material was deleted and no paid external compute was used. Final documentation/Git closure charges append to the mutable local resource receipt.

## Query-owner source separation — bounded positive, September 9

**Retain `4d81c3b0`**, CID `blake3:4d81c3b003499648e47248fb8d5d4a50622f6cc0fbad83f0baad2f6cf25b3fac`. The [query-owner result](../native_geometric_query_owner_selection_973.md) and [evidence](../evidence/native_geometric_query_owner_selection_973.json) supersede the pointer below. Two correctly stored revision chains exposed a direct-reader tie: the queried Copper occurrence and unrelated Cove both reached H4 state [35,119], score 13. The candidate maps Copper to [38,119], score 14, while Cove remains unchanged. Three existing code rows change relative to `7f70029e`; the 286-code vocabulary, feature law, candidate admission and tie-break remain unchanged. The reader is refitted from the same frozen writer parent `231d6950`, with all 80 constraints passing. No serving matrix product, transformer, provider, parser or new representation is introduced.

The 24 competing-owner contrasts pass 24/24, versus retained baseline 22/24. Complete construction passes 82/82 labelled answers and 1,182/1,182 inherited comparisons against frozen writer parent `231d6950`; all 1,172 actual output/EOS/source/record comparisons against retained reader `7f70029e` remain exact. The earlier reader stress now passes 16/16 versus 15/16, preserving every previously correct answer. Writer construction/stress/prior-fresh panels and the earlier reader fresh draw pass unchanged. New post-selection transfer passes **72/72** labelled answers versus baseline **66/72**, all 36 current selections and all 36 inherited comparisons, without refit. All previously correct fresh baseline answers retain their exact output and applicable identities. These are familiar forms with freshly drawn whole owner/value spellings, not general language qualification.

All 14 prior semantic/control reports retain exact applicable outputs and identities, as do 12 multi-turn histories. Word/Rust transfer passes 24/24; Copy→Add and action each pass 24/24 ordinary and 24/24 stress. Twenty-five focused tests pass, including the trace invariant, integer-kernel source guard and both actual current-source/query-owner allocation/checkpoint checks. The scoped native API records 63 PASS and 1 explicit NOT_RUN item for inner writer-only removal controls. Actual generated Rust equalities and identifier-return fragments compile and execute. Both current-source control names remove the same contribution and compare against `231d6950`; they are not independent ablations. `7f70029e` is separately compared. Full historical API, blanket suite, new browser/WASM/HTTP and complete-path energy measurement remain NOT_RUN.

Preserve the first failed preparation and unselected `39575f74`: its 79/80 result exposed incorrect older-parent preservation labels, while all 82 actual labelled answers were correct. The final preparation binds targets to captured baseline direct dispatch and preserves routes that bypass the direct reader. This is a corrected training-target boundary, not evidence of mathematical inconsistency or a model regression. All earlier artifacts, source receipts and charges remain intact.

**Next: learn explicit requested historical-version selection and emission**, preserving current answers, exact owner/occurrence identity, previous links, conflicts, abstention and arithmetic/Rust behavior. Existing historical questions remain incorrect; preserving their output does not establish historical understanding. Arbitrary wording/entity counts, sustained prose, general reasoning/program synthesis, alpha/frontier and complete-path energy advantage remain unqualified. #973 stays open.

## Current-source selection over validated writer state — bounded positive, September 9

**Retain `7f70029e`**, CID `blake3:7f70029e62906da5873b577c5ec1e39fdc273dafa79fa82b1cf522f3e504b4fc`. The [reader/writer integration result](../native_geometric_current_source_integration_973.md) and [evidence](../evidence/native_geometric_current_source_integration_973.json) supersede the pointer below. The accepted writer `231d6950` stores current revisions correctly but still selects an old recent occurrence in the tested reverse-first-fact forms. The existing query-conditioned signed-H4 source refinement is now fitted over that exact writer parent. Six of 30 new feature codes acquire nonidentity transforms; all 77 fitting constraints pass. Artifact validation restores the outer reader's saved router before checking inner writer commitments. Parent geometry, fixed zeta identities, writer, exact occurrence/version payloads, numeric and emission operators remain frozen. Serving adds no matrix products, transformer, provider, phrase parser or unconditional current-record preference.

The reverse-first-fact selvi/Copper request now selects the exact Copper revision rather than emitting ` Ridge holds selvi.\n`. Construction repairs all six new plain/Name/State responses, preserves all 1,166 inherited output/EOS/source/record comparisons, and passes 58/58 labelled answers. Reader stress passes 15/16 versus parent 12/16, with no parent-correct regression. Writer construction retains 172/172 labelled answers, 96/96 target records and 1,057/1,057 inherited comparisons; writer stress retains 16/16 answers and records plus three controls, and the prior fresh writer draw retains 24/24. Post-selection fresh owner/value spellings pass 18/18 labelled answers (parent 9/18), all nine current selections and all 15 inherited comparisons, without refit. Both reader control names remove the same contribution and restore parent behavior; they are not independent channel ablations.

All 14 prior semantic/control reports retain their applicable outputs and identities (0 changed rows), as do 12 multi-turn histories. Earlier word/Rust transfers pass 24/24; Copy→Add and action emission each pass 24/24 ordinary and 24/24 stress. 23 focused tests pass, including the integer-kernel source guard and actual artifact checkpoint/allocation check. The scoped native API records 47 passing checks and 1 explicit NOT_RUN item for inner writer-only removal controls; it executes the combined artifact for behavior. Actual generated Rust equalities and identifier-return fragments compile and execute. Full historical API, blanket suite, new-artifact browser/WASM/HTTP and complete-path energy measurement remain NOT_RUN.

Preserve rejected `4f12bf78`: its narrow reader stress passed 16/16 but two previously correct sentence-leading Now answers regressed from Amber Field to Dusk Ridge despite unchanged records. The balanced refit adds the 19 writer-stress cases as preservation constraints. The one remaining two-owner recent question still copies ` Cove holds tilva.\n` while querying selvi; both revision chains are correct, and this is the exact parent failure. **Next: diagnose query-owner source discrimination across two competing revision chains, then learn explicit historical-version selection.** Capture candidate hints and pre/post-H4 states before changing features. Historical questions retain their earlier wrong spans or malformed Unknown; preservation does not establish historical-language correctness. General prose, general reasoning/program synthesis, alpha/frontier capability and complete-path energy advantage remain unqualified. #973 stays open.

Removing the reader reconstructs `231d6950` byte-exactly. Local evidence root: `/Users/casey.allard/Documents/Codex/2026-09-09/uor-r4-current-source-integration`.

This cycle used **1651.375 model seconds** and **343.092 engineering-command seconds** at the immutable evidence snapshot. Cumulative model use is **30504.955 / 32250.000 seconds**; the preserved 196.620-second reservation leaves 1548.425 seconds. The complete 3,000-model-second projection required a **900-second standing-authorized extension**, recorded before use. Engineering-command projection is 1,200 seconds, with one model process, two threads, 4 GiB model/6 GiB build RAM and 1 GiB new storage. New prompts are bounded to 4,096 bytes/512 tokens and outputs to 96 tokens; inherited windows remain 65,536 bytes/8,192 tokens and five turns with up to 1,056 padding tokens per turn. Conservative accounted storage is **37896278016 / 39158181888 bytes**, leaving 1127686144 bytes after the 128 MiB stop margin. No storage extension, unique deletion or paid external compute occurred.

## Writer-role transfer across value primes — bounded positive, September 9

**Retain `231d6950`**, CID `blake3:231d6950b93db3be52d4ce1df7f20c5dabd0329c2183d228e39c8f271f603dfa`. The [writer-role result](../native_geometric_writer_role_transfer_973.md) and [evidence](../evidence/native_geometric_writer_role_transfer_973.json) supersede the pointer below. Actual traces confirmed the latest Amber revision was misbound because its wrong now/Assert proposal lacked a correction present for Copper and unknown-value contexts. Three new learned nonpositive rows share that correction across candidate value primes while preserving owner/exterior primes, exact boundary and directed separation. All parent `6f5ab4f3` geometry, dictionary, writer/cache, read, emission and numeric operators remain frozen. This cycle fits no new H4 transform and adds no serving matrix product, transformer, provider, phrase parser or owner substitution.

Actual consecutive facts ending in Amber Field now emit ` selvi is in Amber Field.\n`, with Assert/Revise/Revise records, previous links 0/1/2 and only record 3 current. Construction passes 36/36 new responses and full chains (parent 6/36); all 1,057 inherited output/EOS/record/first-decision comparisons and 136 older labelled answers remain exact. Stress passes 16/16 responses and records (parent 10/16), preserving literal-now owners and three older controls. Post-selection fresh whole prompts and owner spellings pass 24/24, including 12 known-value-prime and 12 unknown-value cases, without refit. The two removal-control names both remove the same contribution and restore parent behavior in all 72 construction, 32 stress and 48 fresh comparisons; they are not independent context-channel ablations.

All 14 prior semantic/control reports and 12 multi-turn histories retain exact outputs and applicable identities. Earlier word/Rust transfers pass 24/24; Copy→Add and action emission each pass 24/24 ordinary and 24/24 stress. Seventeen focused tests pass, including the integer-kernel source guard and actual artifact checkpoint/allocation check at 218 input and 57 output positions. The scoped native API passes 29/29 checks; actual generated Rust equalities and identifier-return fragments compile and execute. Full historical API and blanket suite, new browser/WASM/HTTP and combined writer/current-source artifact are NOT_RUN.

The older opened source panel improves 33/40 to 36/40 with 18/18 inherited comparisons and no regressions. **Four recent reverse-first-fact reader failures remain despite correct revision records. Next: integrate query-conditioned current-versus-historical source selection with this validated writer state.** Preserve exact historical occurrence identity, three-fact current chains, conflicts, abstention and previous arithmetic/word behavior. Do not simply prioritize directory membership. Preserve rejected reader `aa1bc159` and all earlier negative candidates; it is not activated on this artifact. General prose, general reasoning/program synthesis, alpha/frontier and complete-path energy advantage remain unqualified. #973 stays open.

Artifact: `.uor-models/native-typed-value-2026-09-05/writer-role/model.json`, SHA256 `7bb912761e09a34edf40731038f700ad90c1aad53188da0967910382fc280d46`, 14,127,792 bytes. Removing the outer block reconstructs the exact retained parent bytes. Local evidence root: `/Users/casey.allard/Documents/Codex/2026-09-09/uor-r4-writer-role-transfer`.

This cycle used **1053.360 model seconds** and **350.487 engineering-command seconds** at the immutable evidence snapshot. Cumulative model use is **28853.580 / 31350.000 seconds**, with the 196.620-second prior reservation leaving 2299.800 seconds. No allowance extension was needed. Complete pre-use projection: 3,000 model seconds, 1,200 engineering-command seconds, one model process, two threads, 4 GiB model/6 GiB build RAM and 1 GiB new storage; new prompts are bounded to 4,096 bytes/512 tokens and outputs to 96 tokens, with inherited windows preserved. Conservative accounted storage is **37521444864 / 39158181888 bytes**, leaving 1502519296 bytes after the 128 MiB stop margin. All cumulative charges and prior reservations remain. No unique deletion or external paid compute occurred. Final small formatting/claim/document/Git closure charges are appended to the local mutable receipt after this immutable snapshot.

## Current-version read experiment — rejected, September 9

**Retain `6f5ab4f3`**, the owner/revision artifact below. The [current-version result](../native_geometric_current_version_read_973.md) and [evidence](../evidence/native_geometric_current_version_read_973.json) preserve rejected candidate `aa1bc159`. Its optional signed-H4 source refinement uses exact current/ancestor occurrence links and lexical-prime query context while freezing the parent. Construction improves all six targeted responses and preserves 1,111 inherited comparisons, but structural stress loses a previously correct answer: after two stated revisions the parent emits Amber Field while the candidate emits Copper Vale. Both stored the last fact incorrectly as owner `now`; the candidate trusts a stale selvi directory entry. Stress improves in aggregate (12/16 versus 9/16), which does not offset that regression. No candidate is promoted and no fresh draw was run.

Five focused unit tests, the kernel source guard, one actual allocation/checkpoint test and 27 scoped native API checks pass. These do not override failed behavioral admission. The full historical API/replay campaign and new browser/WASM/HTTP are NOT_RUN. General prose/reasoning, alpha/frontier and complete-path energy claims remain unqualified.

**Next: repair contextual binding of the latest owner/revision in consecutive facts before trusting current-version membership for source selection.** Preserve the existing correct recent answer, exact historical occurrence identity, literal-now owners, conflicts and valid dependent revisions. The optional rejected reader is retained for matched followup, not activated on the accepted model.

Cumulative model usage is **27800.220 / 31350.000 seconds**; this cycle used 461.293 model and 460.572 engineering-command seconds. The +3,000-second standing-authorized extension was recorded before use; the 196.620-second reservation and 128 MiB storage margin remain. At the immutable evidence snapshot, accounted storage is 37265051648 / 39158181888 bytes. The linked evidence owns the complete projection, command charges, failed runs, artifact hashes and receipt paths. No unique deletion or external paid compute occurred.

## Contextual owner and revision commits — bounded positive, September 9

**Retain `6f5ab4f3`**, CID `blake3:6f5ab4f3e5cad068d72f72795fead8fb1b371c009e5935448c8c20df0794d778`. The [owner/revision result](../native_geometric_owner_revision_973.md) and [evidence](../evidence/native_geometric_owner_revision_973.json) supersede the pointer below. A learned nonpositive residual conditions the existing writer on lexical-prime context, the exact exterior gap and the parent's directed endpoint separation. All parent geometry, dictionary, writer/cache, source and emission routing, field composition and numeric operators remain frozen. Serving retains bounded integer/table geometry with no mathematical matrix products, transformer, provider, phrase parser, global word exclusion or query-owner substitution.

The actual prompt `Record: selvi in Dusk Ridge. selvi now in Copper Vale. Where is selvi? Name the owner first. Answer:` now emits ` selvi is in Copper Vale.\n`, commits Revise with the correct owner and previous link, and retains that answer after eviction. Literal `now` remains a usable owner. The new authored construction targets pass 60/60 (parent 24/60); 76 older dependency/name targets also pass. All 997/997 inherited output/EOS and record comparisons remain exact; these are not independently correct language answers. A new post-selection identity draw passes 28/28 responses and target records, with 8/8 inherited comparisons unchanged. Parent correctness is 12/28; extension removal and gap removal restore parent output/records. Structural stress passes 16/16 target records and 15/16 responses, retaining the separate reversed-first-fact read negative.

All 663 retained construction answers and the complete earlier preservation runner pass, including 48/48 dependent and 28/28 name cases. All 80 prior field construction targets, 30 prior field transfers and now 14/14 prior field stress cases pass. Earlier word/source/abstention, 12 exact histories and 14 semantic/control reports remain preserved. Native API passes 215 checks; 49 unique focused tests pass, including nine actual allocation/checkpoint checks and the kernel source guard. Generated retained Rust equalities and identifier-return fragments compile and execute.

Preserve rejected `19fe175c`: its new construction and fresh targets passed, but it suppressed 12 valid older dependency revisions. The expanded one-gap fit `fcd0ab1d` exposed incompatible corrections over one aliased key. Layout 2 retains the existing directed endpoint separation; all 4,083 expanded constraints then fit with 14 adjustments. No vocabulary exception was added. Legacy layout 1 remains byte-exactly readable. The first incorrect offline byte labels, bounded trace stop and missing output-directory attempt remain preserved as failed or unavailable runner evidence, not model-quality results.

Artifact: `.uor-models/native-typed-value-2026-09-05/owner-revision/model.json`, SHA256 `416fda343c34c68c3aa73a6ca82ae672c93f7a5383f9872b9ead2534fd22cab5`, 13,966,704 bytes. Removing the extension reconstructs parent `d1b0985f` byte-exactly. Both earlier overflow targets retain their wrong output/EOS. General prose, arbitrary instructions, general reasoning, Rust synthesis, alpha/frontier capability and complete-path energy advantage remain unqualified. Consecutive revision repair is measured on the authored construction/stress forms; arbitrary consecutive-revision wording is not qualified. New-artifact browser/WASM/HTTP is NOT_RUN. #973 stays open.

**Next: current-version-aware selection between recent occurrences and retained relations.** The remaining reversed-first-fact case correctly stores and links Copper Vale, but unpadded direct routing selects historical Ridge (source 15, endpoint 18, byte endpoint 17). The direct source/Prepare ranking score is 13 for Ridge versus 12 for Copper; the persistent choice is absent. Padding leaves identical records but activates persistent choice [33, 2], selecting current record 2. Parent and successor reproduce this dispatch difference. Diagnose current-versus-superseded admission and ranking with forward/reverse originals, unchanged records before/after eviction, conflicts, explicit older-version references and abstention. Preserve exact occurrence identity and the compositor's refusal to turn an obsolete source into a current record. Do not substitute the queried owner or globally exclude historical words.

This cycle used **3216.860 model seconds** and **857.821 engineering-command seconds**, including all failed preparations, rejected candidates, unavailable runner attempts, fitting and executed checks. Cumulative model use is **27338.927 / 28350.000 seconds**. The necessary 2,100-second extension was recorded before use; later phase reallocations did not increase the total. The preserved 196.620-second reservation leaves 814.453 seconds. Conservative storage at this evidence checkpoint is **37,161,738,240 / 39,158,181,888 bytes**, including the retained copy and metadata reserve, with 1,862,225,920 bytes remaining after the 128 MiB stop margin. No storage extension was needed. Limits remain one model process, two threads, 4 GiB model RAM, 6 GiB build RAM, 512 configured context tokens and 96 output tokens; inherited five-turn checks permit 1,056 padding tokens per turn and 8,192 total input tokens. Sampled model/build process-tree peaks are 3,688,169,472 / 2,669,707,264 bytes. No unique deletion or paid external compute occurred. Small metadata/document/Git operations are outside the engineering stopwatch; the material behavior-metadata comparison was explicitly charged.

All older artifact/resource pointers and next actions below are historical snapshots.

## Shared owner/value field composition — bounded positive, September 9

**Retain `d1b0985f`**, CID `blake3:d1b0985fb8af0528dae6a7c684e1c76be3634099c868a7f9a3b09454cb68d1c0`. The [field-composition result](../native_geometric_field_composition_973.md) and [evidence](../evidence/native_geometric_field_composition_973.json) supersede the pointer below. The existing signed-H4 lexical selector now chooses learned bytes, exact Owner-read and Value/span-read, Base/defer and Stop over the inherited selected relation. A fixed typed cursor preserves the record and byte occurrence. The writer, source routing, numeric operators and all 1,125 prior lexical transforms remain exact; 820 new transforms are admitted. Serving retains bounded integer/table geometry with no matrix products, transformer, provider, phrase parser or sentence template.

Actual `Name the owner first` / `State the owner first` requests can emit ` selvi is in Dusk Ridge.\n`. Construction passes 80/80 (32 owner-first plus 48 matched value-first); 873/873 inherited documents preserve parent output/EOS and initial/final relations, which is not 873 independently correct answers. Post-selection fixed-form identity transfer passes 30/30 (12 new owner-first plus 18 matched value-first), without refit. Disabling the extension, new context or new learned transforms restores parent output in every owner-first construction/fresh case; exact-read removal loses all these answers and has retained nonterminations. Structural stress passes 12/14, including reverse/equal-valued records, single-word fields, recent-window eviction and two absent-owner abstentions.

All 663 retained answers, 132/28 word construction/open answers, 24 prior word/Rust transfers, 40 source-position cases, 10 original abstentions, 12 exact histories, earlier numeric panels and 254 transition replays pass. Fourteen earlier semantic/control reports match exactly. Native API passes 187 checks; 39 unique focused tests pass, including the source guard and eight actual allocation/checkpoint checks. Actual generated Rust equalities and identifier-return fragments compile and execute.

Artifact: `.uor-models/native-typed-value-2026-09-05/field-composition/model.json`, SHA256 `b33ff399684b86a0495eeae993a1f2e05b88d1d4a38d33bddb3485b5a9146cdf`, 13,819,092 bytes. Removing the extension reconstructs parent `169f23ef` byte-exactly. Both unsuccessful preparations remain preserved: a two-symbol prefix collision and a full-vocabulary feature-cap failure. Two existing overflow targets retain their exact wrong output/EOS. General prose, arbitrary instructions, reasoning, Rust synthesis, alpha/frontier and energy advantage remain unqualified. New-artifact browser/WASM/HTTP is NOT_RUN. #973 stays open.

**Next: contextual owner binding and explicit revision action in the shared writer.** For `selvi in Dusk Ridge. selvi now in Copper Vale.`, the inherited writer stores `selvi → Dusk Ridge` and `now → Copper Vale` as separate assertions with no revision link. The field candidate faithfully emits `now is in Copper Vale` for the recent selection and `selvi is in Dusk Ridge` after eviction. Trace the competing owner and Assert/Revise proposals at the second fact; determine whether a representation distinction is missing before fitting. Learn correct owner/version commits with ordinary assertion, literal-`now`, conflict and distractor controls, then preserve value-first and owner-first behavior before/after eviction. Do not substitute the queried owner into an incorrectly bound record.

This cycle used **1890.025 model seconds** and **551.511 engineering-command seconds**, including unsuccessful preparations and all executed validation. Cumulative model use is **24122.067 / 26250.000 seconds**. The necessary 1,200-second extension was recorded before use; the preserved 196.620-second reservation leaves 1931.313 seconds. Conservative storage at the delivery checkpoint is **36,717,125,632 / 39,158,181,888 bytes**, including retained material, the owner-checkout copy allowance and a 16 MiB metadata reserve, with 2,306,838,528 bytes remaining after the 128 MiB stop margin. No storage extension was needed. Limits remain one model process, two threads, 4 GiB model RAM, 6 GiB build RAM, 512 configured context tokens and 96 output tokens; the inherited five-turn replay permits 1,056 padding tokens per turn and 8,192 total input tokens. Sampled model/build process-tree peaks are 3,215,065,088 / 2,621,243,392 bytes. No unique deletion or paid external compute occurred. Small metadata/document/Git commands are outside the engineering stopwatch.

All older artifact/resource pointers and next actions below are historical snapshots.

## Contextual lexical writer correction — bounded positive, September 9

**Retain `169f23ef`**, CID `blake3:169f23efd1babd314deed5cd523953179d94a8eb9dbf6e930892e57080a85828`. The [writer result](../native_geometric_writer_lexical_973.md) and [evidence](../evidence/native_geometric_writer_lexical_973.json) supersede the pointer below. One offline-learned contextual lexical feature distinguishes an instruction from a fact while keeping the complete parent writer, its certified NoWrite cache, H4/zeta geometry, source correction, shared emission and numeric operators frozen. Serving uses bounded integer/table lookup, with no matrix products, transformer, provider or phrase exception.

Actual writer comparisons pass 825/825, including 64 balanced cases; these check record correction and parent-output preservation, not 825 correct language answers. The exact collision is repaired, and the same words remain usable as factual payloads. Complete history correctness improves from 8/12 to 12/12: four instruction records disappear while every legitimate record, source commitment and answer remains exact. Post-selection fixed-form comparisons pass 32/32 (26 new-prompt identity cases plus 6 repeated factual controls). All 663 retained answers, 132/28 word construction/open answers, 24 prior word/Rust transfer answers, 40 source-position cases and 10 original abstention cases pass. Fourteen earlier semantic/control reports match exactly. Native API passes 176 checks; 32 unique focused tests pass, including the source guard and seven actual allocation/checkpoint checks. Generated Rust checks compile and execute.

Artifact: `.uor-models/native-typed-value-2026-09-05/writer-lexical/model.json`, SHA256 `3594003cc8265a31f5fe512ab38cd68289f5255769f30cf254f1fc7028e00260`, 13,552,256 bytes. Parent `82662f85` and all older material remain preserved. The repair concerns the tested writer contexts, not general instruction understanding. A factual cue-word control retains the correct memory but the parent's malformed prose; both old overflow targets remain wrong. General prose, reasoning, Rust synthesis, alpha and energy advantage are unqualified. New-artifact browser/WASM/HTTP is NOT_RUN. #973 stays open.

**Next: compositional owner/value emission through the shared selector.** Refresh the actual selected relation/version, first emitted field and transition between fields. The current word adapter enters suffix emission only after the value copy completes, so suffix weights cannot place an owner before that value. If this structural limit remains, learn an artifact-bound field choice over the selected relation: owner, connective, value/span and stop, preserving exact byte anchors and all value-first behavior. Use explicitly different owner-first requests; do not assign incompatible answers to the already retained sentence prompts.

This cycle used **1748.183 model seconds** and **552.355 engineering-command seconds**. Cumulative model use is **22232.042 / 25050.000 seconds**. The 2,700-second and 2 GiB extensions were recorded before use under standing authorization. Five unused fitting minutes were reassigned to interface/allocation verification without increasing any total. The preserved 196.620-second reservation leaves 2621.338 seconds. Conservative storage is **36,408,483,840 / 39,158,181,888 bytes**, including the retained copy and 16 MiB metadata reserve, with 2,615,480,320 bytes remaining after the 128 MiB stop margin. Limits remain one model process, two threads, 4 GiB model RAM, 6 GiB build RAM, 512 configured context tokens and 96 output tokens; the inherited five-turn replay explicitly permits 1,056 padding tokens per turn and up to 8,192 total input tokens. Sampled model/build process-tree peaks are 3,041,673,216 / 2,557,296,640 bytes. No unique deletion or paid external compute occurred. Small metadata/document/Git commands are outside the engineering stopwatch.

## Source recency correction and writer collision — bounded positive, September 8

**Retain `82662f85`**, CID `blake3:82662f856908e548a9cccbb78809daf4821d243781ad497b661f5ee6d94c2032`. The [source-role result](../native_geometric_source_roles_973.md) and [evidence](../evidence/native_geometric_source_roles_973.json) supersede the pointer below. A bounded Rust fit neutralizes one existing signed-H4 recency transform, correcting source selection without changing candidate admission, the writer, shared emission, numeric operators or exact occurrence copying. Serving continues through bounded integer/table geometry with no matrix products, transformer, provider or phrase exception.

Actual position answers improve from 32/40 to 40/40; restoring the parent router reproduces all eight failures, including unrelated six-word filler controls. Original absent-owner requests improve from 6/10 to 10/10 Unknown answers. Post-selection transfer with four newly drawn owner/value groups passes 32/32; restored parent parameters score 20/32. These are fixed prompt forms. All 663 retained construction answers, 132 word construction answers, 28 word open answers and 24 previous word/name/Rust transfer answers pass. Fourteen earlier semantic reports match exactly; matched history preserves all 12 outputs and every record/version/pose/phase identity. Native API passes 166/166 checks; 29 unique focused tests pass, including the kernel source guard and six actual-artifact allocation/checkpoint checks. Actual generated Copy/Add Rust equalities and four retained identifier-return fragments compile and execute.

Artifact: `.uor-models/native-typed-value-2026-09-05/source-role-refinement/model.json`, SHA256 `70a5f8867d00a358b2d64556be1ea038c844c7926dfb6388ab01ceb5746ba0ae`, 13,432,797 bytes. Parent `91ede422`, all earlier candidates, source receipts and charges remain preserved. The learned change removes a harmful positional bias; it does not demonstrate general instruction understanding or comparative geometric advantage. The original owner-first sentence targets are not addressed. The two response-entry overflow cases retain their exact wrong output/EOS behavior. New-artifact browser/WASM/HTTP is NOT_RUN; general prose, reasoning, Rust synthesis, alpha and complete-path energy advantage remain unqualified. #973 stays open.

**Next: add a learned contextual lexical/role distinction to the shared writer.** The actual instruction `Where is selvi? Explain in a sentence. Answer:` and factual `Where is selvi? velra in Dusk Ridge. Answer:` produce identical 21-key Assert proposal features at the inspected owner/value slots and identical scores. The four instruction-suffix history variants still introduce extra relations. Weights over identical features cannot distinguish this pair. Expose the missing bounded role distinction, learn write/NoWrite from matched contrasts and check actual commits while preserving exact occurrence/version identity, this read correction, conflicts, abstention and numeric composition. Do not add a hardcoded instruction-word exclusion or parser.

This cycle used **1372.133 model seconds** and **497.487 engineering-command seconds**, including diagnostics, fitting, all controls and actual validation. Cumulative model use is **20483.859 / 22350.000 seconds**. The necessary 1,800-second extension was recorded before use; five minutes of unused fitting allowance were later reassigned to preservation without raising any total limit; the preserved 196.620-second reservation leaves 1669.521 seconds. Conservative storage is **35,905,552,384 / 37,010,698,240 bytes**, including retained material and a 16 MiB metadata reserve, with 970,928,128 bytes remaining after the 128 MiB stop margin. No storage extension was needed. Limits remain one model process, two threads, 512 context tokens, 96 output tokens, 4 GiB model RAM and 6 GiB build RAM. Sampled model/build process-tree peaks are 2,775,465,984 / 2,372,124,672 bytes. No unique deletion or paid external compute occurred. Small metadata/document/Git commands are outside the engineering stopwatch.

## Shared nonnumeric word/span emission — bounded positive, September 8

**Retain `91ede422`**, CID `blake3:91ede422c51a2e80aa0dc4f579a005d94a60e8023a0960d7d891f98cc7e7db9b`. The [word-emission result](../native_geometric_word_emission_973.md) and [evidence](../evidence/native_geometric_word_emission_973.json) supersede the artifact pointer below. Exact completed word/span reads now enter the existing shared signed-H4 lexical selector. For example, the actual copied value Ash Court can become ` Ash Court is the place.\n` or ` Ash Court is the stop.\n`. Offline learned Base/defer choices preserve inherited plain and Rust continuations; all 660 numeric lexical codes and the rest of parent 2dc63b2c remain frozen. Serving uses bounded integer/table geometry, with no matrix product, transformer, provider or sentence template.

Construction passes 132/132, open 28/28, and post-selection fixed-form transfer 24/24 (20 fact/name/value cases and four new Rust identifier returns). Disabling the new emitter, word context or its learned geometric transforms reduces open correctness to 6/28. All 663 retained construction answers and earlier preservation panels pass. Fourteen earlier semantic reports match exactly; matched history preserves all 12 outputs and complete record/source/version/pose/phase identities. Native API passes 134 checks. 26 unique focused tests pass, including the kernel source guard and six actual-artifact allocation/checkpoint checks. All 24 actual generated Copy/Add Rust equalities and four fresh identifier-return fragments compile and execute; the four fragments pass eight input/output assertions.

Preserve all six unsuccessful checkpoints, especially rejected `9e8d9cfb`: its new open answers passed, but it regressed 100 retained Rust continuations and two ledger answers. Training the existing Base/defer option on the actual parent continuations repaired these regressions. No runtime exception or phrase gate was added. The final allocation test also exposed an incorrect counter-ownership assertion; its corrected rerun passes, and the failed receipt remains preserved.

Artifact: `.uor-models/native-typed-value-2026-09-05/word-sentence/model.json`, SHA256 `a98846a05dbc88d6419e1320b289ef07d5b3136677b2542a7ffc5abded479cc3`, 13,233,012 bytes. These are two authored value-first endings, not sustained general prose. The original twelve owner-first sentence targets remain unrepaired. Four absent-owner stop requests still select unrelated facts (6/10 abstention, all prior correct Unknowns preserved). Two 33-step targets overflow the existing 32-step response-entry limit and produce wrong trailing output, including one nontermination at the 96-token harness cap. New-artifact browser/WASM/HTTP remains NOT_RUN; arbitrary wording, general reasoning, Rust synthesis, alpha and energy advantage remain unqualified. #973 stays open.

**Next: instruction-versus-fact role binding in the shared nonnumeric read/write path.** Trace matched absent-owner stop requests and the four history instruction-suffix variants that introduce an extra relation. Repair the observed geometric role/admission boundary while preserving exact occurrence/version identity, the shared emitter, numeric composition and correct abstention. Owner-first reordering and longer response lifetime remain separate unfinished capabilities; do not expand capacity or add a parser without the diagnostic evidence.

This cycle used **2663.365 model seconds** and **1255.643 engineering-command seconds**, including rejected fits, failed assertions, preparation and reruns. Cumulative model use is **19111.726 / 20550.000 seconds**. Both necessary extensions were recorded before use; the preserved 196.620-second reservation leaves 1241.654 seconds. Conservative storage is **35,638,030,336 / 37,010,698,240 bytes**, including the retained copy and 16 MiB metadata reserve, with 1,238,450,176 bytes remaining after the 128 MiB stop margin. Cycle storage allowance remains 1.5 GiB. One model process, two threads, 512 context tokens, 96 output tokens, 4 GiB model RAM and 6 GiB build RAM remain configured. Sampled model/build process-tree peaks are 2,472,624,128 / 2,598,682,624 bytes. No unique deletion or paid external compute occurred. Small metadata/document/Git commands are outside the engineering stopwatch.

## Shared Copy→Add dependencies — bounded positive, September 8

**Retain `2dc63b2c`**, CID `blake3:2dc63b2c7b7073155fd3c5a8c743eaaace66f409483d86dd390966d4f9fc03f6`. The [Copy→Add result](../native_geometric_copy_add_1140.md) and [evidence](../evidence/native_geometric_copy_add_1140.json) supersede earlier pointers. Shared signed-H4 role and continuation refinement now selects Copy-original or Copy-extra, optionally followed by Add using the newly copied record. With history 17 and extra 3, Copy-extra→Add-original emits `3 is 3.\n20 is 17 plus 3.\n` or `3 == 3\n20 == 17 + 3\n`, with exact ordered records, reads and learned Stop. The lexical emitter and fixed geometry remain identical to parent 5ed24f4e.

Construction passes 36/36, open 24/24, reversed/equal-value stress 24/24 and post-selection numeric/name transfers 24/24. Copied-result exclusion preserves the first Copy and learned Stop in every case (ordinary-target correctness is reported separately). Restoring parent binding reduces open correctness to 6/24, restoring parent continuation to 12/24, and disabling action context, exact record reads or learned emission geometry to 8/24 each. All 663 retained answers and earlier panels, including both 16-case history-chain populations, 254 transition replays and 72 exact lexical outputs pass. Thirteen of fourteen historical reports and all fourteen prior action-emission reports match exactly. Eight already-incorrect historical control rows change wrong outputs or identities, with every previously correct row and correctness count preserved. Native API passes 117 checks; 22 unique focused tests, the kernel source guard and five actual artifact allocation/checkpoint checks pass. All 36 actual generated Rust equality lines from open/stress/fresh panels compile and execute.

Preserve binding checkpoints `2bfe4a27` and `d22b1c85` and rejected joint `9365f229`: despite all new open cases passing, it regressed eight earlier two-history Copy requests. The accepted retry adds all 32 original-parent chain contexts to 527 preservation contexts; the rejection and charges remain visible.

Artifact: `.uor-models/native-typed-value-2026-09-05/copy-add/model.json`, SHA256 `bec859344be857eced857adf6ee360bccbacc81d91282de7eed31bb4aa0e5233`, 13,132,214 bytes. #1140's bounded acceptance is satisfied by the combined retained composition and emission evidence. Three-operation learned stopping, arbitrary wording, general prose/reasoning, Rust synthesis, alpha and energy advantage remain unqualified. New-artifact browser/WASM/HTTP remains NOT_RUN.

**Next: move to #973's linguistic learner.** Diagnose currently passing nonnumeric fact answers under complete-sentence requests, tracing exact source/span/version identity and shared lexical activation. Source inspection shows that completion currently anchors only to a committed numeral, while word/span answers use a separate copy path. If the correct source is retained but cannot enter shared emission, add a bounded typed word/span anchor and exact-read path through the existing geometric selector. If wording first disrupts source selection, repair that observed boundary. Preserve the numeric emitter and abstention controls; do not add a parallel decoder or sentence template. Arbitrary wording and sustained prose remain unqualified.

This cycle used **2295.009 model seconds** and **397.988 engineering-command seconds**, including rejected candidates, failed preparation, interrupted stress work and all reruns. Cumulative model use is **16448.361 / 17250.000 seconds**. The 1,800-second extension was recorded before use; the later five-minute cycle extension stays within that unchanged cumulative limit. Preserve the 196.620-second reservation, leaving 605.019 seconds. Conservative storage is **35,169,001,472 / 37,010,698,240 bytes**, with the 128 MiB stop margin and 16 MiB metadata reserve preserved. An interrupted stress control exposed underestimated full-checkpoint report storage; a 2 GiB extension was recorded before further use, bringing this cycle's storage ceiling to 3.5 GiB. Compact JSON for subsequent reports preserves all fields. Limits remain one model process, two threads, 512 context tokens, 96 output tokens, 4 GiB model RAM and 6 GiB build RAM. Sampled model/build process-tree peaks are 2,512,551,936 / 2,416,443,392 bytes. No unique deletion or paid external compute occurred. Small metadata/document/Git commands are outside the engineering stopwatch.

## Shared action-conditioned emission — bounded positive, September 8

**Retain `5ed24f4e`**, CID `blake3:5ed24f4e7487b6f9cb7fb762fc8bcc9092152f40cb756d864a82880d08ca867d`. The [action-emission result](../native_geometric_action_emission_1140.md) and [evidence](../evidence/native_geometric_action_emission_1140.json) supersede the artifact pointer below. The shared signed-H4 role and continuation routers plus new Copy-tagged lexical roots now emit formatted Add→Copy of the latest result or original total. With actual history 17 and extra 3, Copy-original emits `20 is 3 plus 17.\n17 is 17.\n` or `20 == 3 + 17\n17 == 17\n`, with exact pending/committed operands and reads, learned Stop and fresh-record independent followups. Existing lexical parameters and fixed geometry remain bound to parent `9ab64902`.

Construction passes 36/36, open 24/24, reversed/equal-value stress 24/24 and separate post-selection fresh transfers 24/24. Restoring old binding, continuation or emission, or erasing only action context, loses all eight formatted Copy open answers; exact-read and learned-emission-transform controls lose all sixteen formatted answers. All 663 retained answers, earlier panels, 254 transition replays and 72 exact lexical outputs pass. Twelve of fourteen prior reports are exact; eighteen already-incorrect control rows change wrong output/identities while every previously correct row and correctness count is preserved. Native API passes 91 checks, 21 unique focused tests/source guard and four actual allocation/checkpoint checks pass, and 42 actual generated Rust equalities compile and execute. Preserve binding-only `a6faba85`, rejected first joint `61e24998` and all earlier candidates and charges. New lexical and continuation labels are offline teacher-forced construction; free generation is separate evaluation.

Artifact: `.uor-models/native-typed-value-2026-09-05/action-emission/model.json`, SHA256 `1979d9a13c44f36c2dccf0833a0f16900833339bdc2b50af30b710a9eddfb134`, 12,895,470 bytes. The result covers four authored operation forms crossed with three output styles. Copy→Add, three-operation learned stopping, arbitrary wording, general prose, Rust synthesis, alpha and energy advantage remain unqualified. New-artifact browser/WASM/HTTP remains NOT_RUN. **Next: diagnose Copy→Add with a changed dependency on the copied record, then refine the shared routers at the observed seam**, preserving current formatting, exact identity and independent-turn behavior. #1140 remains open.

This cycle used **1445.811 model seconds** and **653.576 engineering-command seconds**, including the stopped binding fit, rejected joint candidate, failed driver build and all validation. Cumulative model use is **14153.352 / 15450.000 seconds**. The 2,100-second extension was recorded before use under standing authorization; the interface projection later moved 360 seconds from the existing retry allowance without raising the cycle or cumulative limits. Preserve the 196.620-second prior reservation, leaving 1100.028 seconds after it. Conservative storage is **32,767,975,424 / 34,863,214,592 bytes**, including the retained copy, positive storage high-water charges and 16 MiB final metadata reserve, with the 134,217,728-byte stop margin preserved. Limits remain one model process, two threads, 512 context tokens, 96 output tokens, 4 GiB model RAM, 6 GiB build RAM and 1.5 GiB new storage. Sampled peak model/build process-tree RSS is 2,195,947,520 / 2,693,267,456 bytes. Small documentation/receipt/Git commands are outside the engineering-command stopwatch. No unique material was deleted and no paid external compute was used.

## Mixed Add/Copy and exact references — bounded positive, September 8

**Retain 9ab64902**, CID blake3:9ab64902d4811f4e23e2119bdee74f16a6675eee7446e85e21666dfccfabea59. The [mixed operator result](../native_geometric_mixed_operators_1140.md) and [evidence](../evidence/native_geometric_mixed_operators_1140.json) supersede the artifact pointer below. After actual history 17 and an extra-3 Add, the model now emits 20 then 20 for Copy-latest, 20 then 17 for Copy-original, or 20 then 23 for Again, with exact ordered committed operands and learned Stop. Existing shared signed-H4 role and operation routers are refined; the lexical emitter and fixed geometry remain bound to parent 866cb92d.

Construction passes 12/12, open 8/8, reversed/equal-value stress 8/8 and post-selection numeric/name transfers 8/8. Candidate exclusion now stops when the requested latest operand cannot participate while preserving available Copy-original. This is intervention-trained robustness, not memory erasure evidence. All 663 retained answers, earlier panels, 254 transition replays and 72 exact lexical outputs pass. 13 of 14 historical reports match exactly; 8 already-incorrect current-query removal rows change wrong outputs/IDs without losing a previously correct row. 65 native API checks, five mixed/six read/six operator tests, source guard, actual mixed/composed/lexical zero-allocation checks and 54 compiled generated Rust equalities pass. Preserve the stopped first fit, rejected c24ab204, superseded 7e0f5780, rejected a107f3e5 and 66f3d262 with all charges. The final preservation includes actual independent turns after composed histories and complete historical numeric contexts; mixed evaluation checks fresh-record independent turns too.

Artifact: .uor-models/native-typed-value-2026-09-05/mixed-operators/model.json, SHA256 14c76d1375eadec57cb34e9fff98c43b52f16926495c8493bc530c2e077e0de5, 12,562,902 bytes. Plain mixed Add/Copy under four authored forms is qualified; formatted Copy, Copy→Add, three-operation learned stopping, arbitrary instructions, general prose, Rust synthesis, alpha and energy advantage remain unqualified. New-artifact browser/WASM/HTTP remains NOT_RUN. **Next: diagnose mixed-operation formatted emission, then learn shared action-conditioned emission if the observed failures confirm that seam.** #1140 remains open.

This cycle used **2739.786 model seconds** and **1037.308 engineering-command seconds**, including all failed fits, rejected candidates and repeated preservation checks. Cumulative model use is **12707.541 / 13350.000 seconds**. The pre-use increments were 900 seconds, then 600 seconds and another 600 seconds under standing local authorization; the cycle allowance was extended from 1,800 to 3,000 model seconds before use. Retain the 196.620-second reservation, leaving 445.839 seconds after it. Conservative storage is **32,580,792,320 / 34,863,214,592 bytes**, including the retained artifact copy and 8 MiB final metadata reserve, with the 134,217,728-byte stop margin preserved. The projection keeps one model process, two threads, 512 context tokens, 96 output tokens, 4 GiB model RAM, 6 GiB build RAM and 1 GiB new storage. Sampled peak model/build process-tree RSS is 1,899,954,176 / 2,447,785,984 bytes. Small documentation/receipt/Git commands are outside the engineering-command stopwatch.

## Composed Add and formatted output — bounded positive, September 8

**Retain `866cb92d`**, CID `blake3:866cb92de4ad5c130da811d3f2fe8828aed1fe9b2b39b9c9b3c7ad3dbf7dee62`. The [result](../native_geometric_composed_output_1140.md) and [evidence](../evidence/native_geometric_composed_output_1140.json) supersede the artifact pointer below. The existing shared signed-H4 operation router now continues after formatted output. After actual history 17, the tested extra-3 “Again” request emits `20 is 3 plus 17.\n23 is 3 plus 20.\n` or the corresponding two Rust equalities. The second Add reads the first committed result; exact ordered writes/read identities, captured input, checkpoint state and learned Stop are checked. The emitter, dictionaries, other routers and fixed geometry remain exact to parent `ccbe7f2a`.

Construction passes 42/42, open 28/28, reversed initial fact order 28/28 and post-selection fresh transfers 28/28. Restoring the previous operation router loses twelve formatted continuations; excluding the latest intermediate loses all fourteen second operations while preserving single-operation answers. All 663 retained answers, earlier reports, 254 construction-preservation cases and 72 exact old lexical outputs pass. Fourteen prior result/control reports match saved actual text and decision identities. Actual native API passes 50 checks; 54 generated Rust equalities compile and evaluate. Six read and six operator tests, source guard and actual composed/prior lexical zero-allocation checks pass. Preserve rejected `ae245428` (ten old answers continued incorrectly), superseded `9805e99d` (training/checker boundary correction), and all earlier material.

Artifact: `.uor-models/native-typed-value-2026-09-05/composed-output/model.json`, SHA256 `3a951eb5cf88af0982bcafac3ac0a00ac1340dca3078413a95424fb749db38f0`. This establishes repeated Add under seven authored formatting placements, not mixed operator sequencing, arbitrary instruction following, general prose, Rust program synthesis, alpha or energy advantage. New-artifact browser/WASM/HTTP remains NOT_RUN. **Next: learn mixed shared Copy/Add sequences and operand references, with changed intermediate dependencies and stopping positions**, preserving the retained result. #1140 remains open; #973 owns broader language learning.

Cumulative model use is **9,967.755 / 11,250.000 seconds**, including this cycle's 920.669 seconds and all failures/retries. The 900-second extension was recorded before use. Keep the 196.620-second reservation, leaving 1,085.625 seconds after it. Conservative storage is 32,033,710,080 / 34,863,214,592 bytes, including the retained copy and 8 MiB final metadata reserve, with the 128 MiB stop margin retained. Read the new receipt before execution; older resource figures, artifact pointers and next directions below are historical snapshots.

## Contextual instruction binding — bounded positive, September 8

**Retain `ccbe7f2a`**, CID `blake3:ccbe7f2a5038b0707a26b8a85d8b67ee274fd82b2a7f1b8afd7121ad2ada46ad`. The [result](../native_geometric_instruction_binding_1140.md) and [evidence](../evidence/native_geometric_instruction_binding_1140.json) supersede the artifact pointer below. Ordinary tested sentence/Rust instructions now preserve the selected Add and exact ordered operands, producing `17 is 4 plus 13.\n` or `17 == 4 + 13\n`. The existing literal-selection and admission routers are refined; the emitter, operator transitions, dictionaries and geometry remain bound to parent `0f0f5fe4`. Preserve that parent, superseded `db6c7781`, rejected `f17dd654` and `f76521ab`, and all earlier material.

Construction passes 72/72, open 24/24, changed names/fact order 24/24 and post-selection numeric transfers 24/24. Restoring both parent routers leaves 8/24 open responses correct. All 663 main retained answers, all earlier panels and 72 exact prior lexical outputs pass. Prior operators 24/24, current-query 48/48 and harder histories 16/16 retain their controls. Actual native API passes 38 checks; 30 generated Rust equalities compile and evaluate. Six read and six operator tests, the source guard and an eight-case actual zero-allocation/checkpoint check pass. The previous candidate was rejected for eleven earlier-panel failures despite passing the new panels and all 663 main answers.

Artifact: `.uor-models/native-typed-value-2026-09-05/instruction-binding/model.json`, SHA256 `1ee9a8f6e537c2c5da4f49e76bbe136ff827b4818a1f615236ba0004caffdeb5`. The twelve authored request/placement forms and their numeric/name/order transfers do not establish arbitrary instruction following, general prose, full Rust synthesis, alpha or energy advantage. New-artifact browser/WASM/HTTP and combined two-operation formatted output are NOT_RUN. **Next: combine the retained within-response operator transitions with formatted emission**, preserving exact intermediate and operand identities, current-query boundaries, stopping and abstention. #1140 remains open.

Cumulative model use is **9,047.086 / 10,350.000 seconds**, including this cycle's 886.106 seconds and all failures/retries. No cumulative extension was needed. The 196.620-second reservation leaves 1,106.294 seconds after it. Conservative storage is 31,593,533,440 / 34,863,214,592 bytes, including the retained copy and 4 MiB final metadata reserve, with the 128 MiB stop margin retained. Read the new receipt before execution; all older resource values and next directions below are historical.

## Shared lexical and exact-record emission — bounded positive, September 8

**Retain `0f0f5fe4`**, CID `blake3:0f0f5fe4d58d65fb7769ac73fe839973a3eb579cf65f327fe8a2e9a6ecd0468b`. The [result](../native_geometric_lexical_emission_1140.md) and [evidence](../evidence/native_geometric_lexical_emission_1140.json) supersede the artifact pointer below. A shared signed-H4 byte/EOS and exact-record selector now emits the tested sentence `17 is 4 plus 13.\n` or Rust equality `17 == 4 + 13\n` from actual committed values. Parent `6f20982c`, rejected `0e2c48c0` and `03bdfad1`, and all earlier material remain preserved.

Construction and open pass 18/18 each, changed names/mention order 12/12, and post-selection numeric transfers 24/24. Emitter, read and learned-transform controls each preserve six plain answers and lose all twelve formatted answers. All 663 retained answers and earlier panels pass, as do prior operators 24/24, current-query 48/48 and harder histories 16/16 with their dependency controls. Actual API passes 20 checks; 18 actual generated Rust equalities compile and evaluate. Six read-state tests, six operator tests, checkpoint/allocation checks and the source guard pass. The second candidate was rejected for 72 failed preservation rows despite its construction/open gains.

The artifact is `.uor-models/native-typed-value-2026-09-05/lexical-emission/model.json`, SHA256 `fb29718bd4cb0832a91ee1c1e0197baaf8d15fdabd773499a277e7067d3f3685`. These are two authored output forms with numeric and limited name/order transfer. General prose, flexible instruction following, full Rust synthesis, alpha and energy advantage remain unqualified. Combined two-operation formatted output and new-artifact browser/WASM/HTTP are NOT_RUN. **Next: shared contextual instruction binding across selection and emission**, addressing ordinary wording that currently disturbs upstream value selection, then combine operator transitions with formatted output. #1140 remains open.

Cumulative model use is **8,160.980 / 10,350.000 seconds**, including this cycle's 406.757 seconds. The 900-second extension was recorded before use. Preserve the 196.620-second reservation, leaving 1,992.400 seconds after it. Conservative storage is 31,451,942,912 / 34,863,214,592 bytes with the 128 MiB stop margin retained. Read the new receipt before execution; all resource values and next directions below are historical snapshots.

## Learned within-response operator transition — bounded positive, September 8

**Retain `6f20982c`**, CID `blake3:6f20982c52ee5e80ba64274690e1b1bd12c9db2d4c6e539c04366a081569e082`. The [result](../native_geometric_operation_transition_1140.md) and [evidence](../evidence/native_geometric_operation_transition_1140.json) supersede the artifact pointer below. A learned shared signed-H4 Stop/Copy/Add selector consumes exact committed state. After a prior 17, the tested extra-3 “Again” query emits `20.\n23.\n`; the second Add names the first result's write ID, then learned Stop ends below the three-operation cap.

Construction passes 36/36, open 24/24 and post-selection fresh numeric transfers 24/24. Disabling the transition or excluding its latest result from operator proposals leaves all 16 single-operation open answers correct and loses all eight second operations. All 663 retained answers, earlier panels, prior 48 current-query cases and 16 harder histories pass. The actual API now passes the composed answer after checkpoint import; a captured-query boundary defect exposed during testing was repaired, and its failed receipt is preserved. Preserve parent `ddc943f9`, rejected Stop-only `65402ddc`, and all earlier material.

The local artifact is `.uor-models/native-typed-value-2026-09-05/operation-transition/model.json`, SHA256 `6ce30a2ddbcb1a99408016b1065e9ca70ed5879d7f0f8808ec24b8e7db17bb10`. **Next: shared learned lexical choice and ordered sentence/Rust-expression emission from committed values.** Finite numeric response forms do not qualify general prose, reasoning/coding, alpha or energy advantage. New-artifact browser/WASM is NOT_RUN; the added optional block requires the updated runtime. #1140 remains open.

Current cumulative model use is **7,754.223 / 9,450.000 seconds**, including this cycle's 312.644 seconds. The 900-second extension was recorded before use. Preserve the 196.620-second prior reservation; available time after it is 1,499.157 seconds. Conservative storage is 31,343,718,400 / 34,863,214,592 bytes with the 128 MiB stop margin retained.

## Current-query operand refinement — bounded positive, September 8

**Retain `ddc943f9`**, CID `blake3:ddc943f95901389f741b49f14dba48d2a4bae19805285bbd7cb416fca8e510c9`, at bounded current-query/shared-continuation scope. The [result](../native_geometric_current_query_1140.md) and [evidence](../evidence/native_geometric_current_query_1140.json) supersede the recovery artifact pointer below. Parent `79710468`, rejected `b2da9f9a`, and first-fit `51603beb` remain preserved. No serving code or feature representation changes; additional offline contrasts train the existing shared signed-H4 selector.

Construction passes 255/255, open 48/48 and harder one-through-four-history checks 16/16. Removing the original generated result leaves all 32 independent questions correct while all 16 dependent answers change. All 663 retained answers and recorded preservation panels pass. The exact API/checkpoint sequence now answers 17 after independent answers 17 and 18, repairing the old 35/Unknown result. Selection precedes 24/24 fresh numeric-transfer cases, including signed values; finite query forms and names remain a limitation.

The local artifact is `.uor-models/native-typed-value-2026-09-05/current-query-refinement/model.json`; SHA256 `fe31404930998ff33fc57c463af921b989a5f6140a43ee127cf57a38acc5fe9c`. **Next: learned within-response Continue/Stop and compositional emission from actual committed state**, preserving current-literal versus prior-result selection. General prose, generalized reasoning/coding and energy advantage remain unqualified; #1140 is not complete. Read the new evidence receipt for the cumulative ledger and storage snapshot before further execution.

Current cumulative model use is **7,441.579 / 8,550.000 seconds**, including this cycle's 480.927 seconds. The prior unverified-work reservation remains 196.620 seconds, leaving 911.801 seconds after reservation. The 900-second extension was recorded before this cycle. Storage retains the existing 34,863,214,592-byte ceiling and 128 MiB stop margin; exact accounting and the unchanged total storage projection are in the new receipt. Earlier resource figures below remain historical.

## Earlier September 8 recovery — qualification withdrawn

The following preserves the recovery decision before the current-query refinement above; its artifact pointer, next step and resource values are historical snapshots.

The alpha-qualified claim introduced by PRs #1190–#1195 is withdrawn. The source audit found nonempty-output criteria labeled as prose/reasoning/coding qualification, literal security PASS flags, estimated stage splits labeled as measurements, and fixed power/thermal values. [The recovery record](recovery-2026-09-08.md) preserves the exact audited revision and findings. Earlier September 8 claims remain accessible in the [audited historical state](https://github.com/UOR-Foundation/uor-r4/blob/f8e9fa32/docs/integration/current-state.md); they are not current acceptance evidence.

**Retain `blake3:79710468e3b75905550c15fbea62079e4267df774dbf4bc90ea45114826e4bfd` as the default at its existing contextual writer scope.** Source baseline: PR #1176, merge `4f9d02a29ceb0f4ca56ff174169d26cb5c6a518f`. General prose, generalized reasoning, broad coding, alpha qualification and complete-path energy advantage remain unqualified.

The recovery implements required artifact loading, repaired session/checkpoint/streaming boundaries and explicitly unqualified diagnostics. Actual retained-artifact API/direct-output checks and Chrome/WASM generation, checkpoint import/export and queued cancellation have been exercised. They establish the named interface behavior, not general model correctness. The retained artifact also passes all 663 retained answers and the prior preservation panels on the recovery runtime in `E/retained-final-preservation/result.json`. See [the recovery evidence and usage](recovery-2026-09-08.md) and [the source/receipt/resource entry point](../evidence/native_recovery_2026_09_08.json).

**Do not promote experimental `b2da9f9a`.** Its frozen-parent shared role refinement passes 183/183 construction, 12/12 open (parent 8/12), 0/12 intermediate-removal dependency control and 12/12 fresh cases run after recorded selection. It preserves all 663 retained answers and the prior recorded arithmetic, phrase, long-window and dependent-read panels. Nevertheless, the later same-session API check exposes a regression outside those panels: after independent sums 13+4→17 and 14+4→18, repeating the 13+4 question produces `35.\n`; `79710468` produces ` Unknown.\n`. Original and restored checkpoints agree in both artifacts. Byte parity passes while semantic correctness fails; changing abstention to a wrong value prevents promotion.

Preserve the exact experimental CID `blake3:b2da9f9acb9497f39e70cc6846647ebfaa68f7baeceb5c164d35d5d23c1017e0`, SHA256 `a1cd0417f499768a3ea7404d0224c1d891d94a4cb4f7467d9b1c7e94219ed654`, and its earlier `8bc80bf9` / `eb011ae5` regression candidates. The [experiment record](recovery-2026-09-08.md#shared-role-experiment-and-retention-decision) binds local receipts, training scope and failed controls. Separately, the retained baseline's opt-in generated-chain diagnostic executes with its real artifact and fails its six-case target at 3/6; this is an explicit negative, not a skipped or passing test.

**Next: distinguish current-query literal occurrences from multiple previous derived results in the shared geometric router.** Extend source/dependency provenance and matched complete-output controls before implementing within-response learned transitions or compositional emission. The experiment exercises explicit response boundaries and bounded numeral output; it does not complete #1140 or general prose. Keep all prior positive and negative candidates, source freezes, cumulative resource charges and unique material. Read the live ledger and recovery projection before further execution; historical balances below are snapshots, not available allowance.

### Current recovery resource snapshot

The [recovery receipt](../evidence/native_recovery_2026_09_08.json) records cumulative model use **6,960.652 / 7,650.000 seconds**, including this cycle's 1,765.116 seconds and every retry. A 196.620-second reservation for prior unverified claimed work is retained, leaving **492.728 seconds available after that reservation**. Model execution uses one process, two threads, a 512-token context and a 4 GiB model RSS limit; builds have a 6 GiB limit. Current conservative storage accounting is **31,028,420,608 / 34,863,214,592 bytes**, with the 134,217,728-byte stop margin reserved and 3,700,576,256 bytes effective accounted headroom. This accounting is not filesystem free space.

The browser-final phase exceeded its 480.000-second projection by 26.625 seconds; all 506.625 seconds were charged, and no retroactive extension is claimed. Overall cycle/cumulative ceilings stayed intact. Later browser work used an explicit worker hard stop. No unique material was deleted and no external compute was used. Refresh the live ledger/storage receipt before any successor; the older September 7 figures below must not be reused as current allowance.

## Contextual writer boundaries — bounded positive, 2026-09-07

This section preserves the September 7 result and then-current next step/resources; the September 8 decision above supersedes its scheduling and interface status.

**Retain `79710468` at contextual writer scope.** The
[result](../native_geometric_writer_refinement_1139.md) and
[evidence](../evidence/native_geometric_writer_refinement_1139.json) record
warm refinement of the retained `50dc0d23` writer. Learned endpoint-edge
separator/adjacency features distinguish source gaps previously erased by the
masked lexical/role representation. The 23-word dictionary, signed-H4 role
geometry, candidate support and all other parent parameters remain fixed.
The full parent reconstructs byte-identically. No parser, hard sentence-admission
rule, serving matrix product or transformer is added.

All 232 construction writer labels and 32 new construction answers pass. Open
answers/writes improve 8/12 to 12/12; prior phrases improve 74/76 to 76/76,
including both previously missing `quiet river` writes. Cached and uncached
outputs and writes match on all 320 compared cases. The 247-entry NoWrite cache
includes complete endpoint-gap metadata; periodic proposals are disabled for
this law. Selection precedes 12/12 fresh evicted phrases and 4/4 fresh short
boundary objects. The four short cases retain their raw source; they do not
qualify object persistence after eviction.

All 663 retained answers, earlier span panels, 28/28 long-window and 48/48
dependent reads, forward/reverse sessions and selected preservation pass.
Preserve the coefficient-only `990ccbce` negative: it repaired the writes but
regressed eight object-span answers. Diagnosis found two preexisting false
cross-boundary writes in the parent; removing one exposed the other. The new
eight construction and four fresh boundary cases directly record zero writes;
the old eight span cases establish restored outputs. No isolated boundary-
feature ablation was measured.

A matched diagnostic also establishes **41 preexisting reader failures among
200 historical writer anchors**: both parent and candidate reach 159/200 against
the old response targets, with all 200 actual outputs and writes unchanged.
Keep those failures visible. This is a writer repair, not general correctness,
arbitrary punctuation understanding or broad language qualification.

The actual artifact passes malformed parent/dictionary/cache rejection,
every-step checkpoint restoration and zero-allocation ingestion/emission.
The root CLI emits ` quiet river.\n` with EOS and also loads the earlier
coefficient-only artifact. Load is 15.840 seconds; short ingestion is
0.018–0.240 ms, evicted ingestion 3.955 ms and maximum predict/observe 0.250 ms
in the recorded scope. No speed or energy advantage is established.
Studio/WASM/HTTP integration remains `NOT_RUN`.

**Next: implement a shared causal Add→Add transition.** The second operator must
consume the actual first committed result and retain its write ID as an operand
dependency. Refresh the source view from committed state through a bounded
learned transition, then compose the emitted answer. Independent copied text
plus arithmetic is insufficient. #1139, #1140 and #973 remain open.

This cycle charges 292.555 model seconds. Cumulative use is
5,163.298/5,250 seconds, leaving 86.702 seconds. The necessary 300-second and
128 MiB extensions were recorded before use; the correction required no further
increase. Broad storage is capped at 8,204,058,624 bytes with the 128 MiB stop
margin and all prior charges preserved. No unique material was deleted or paid
external compute used. Project the complete successor before execution and use
the standing authorization for any necessary extension.

## Contextual phrase starts — bounded positive, 2026-09-07

**Retain `50dc0d23` at contextual phrase-start scope.** The
[result](../native_geometric_contextual_start_1139.md) and
[evidence](../evidence/native_geometric_contextual_start_1139.json) record the
existing signed-H4 start selector extended with exact ordered lexical/prime
context. The construction-only registry admits words recurring across distinct
exact owners chosen by the fixed parent writer. Complete `321e990f` parent
parameters, candidate admission, endpoint, payload and version semantics are
preserved. Four predecessor/first prime-pair codes and five unary lexical codes
learn nonidentity roots; writer-role features are available but remain identity.

Supported construction is 50/50 versus parent 12/50 and context-disabled 38/50.
Open development is 12/12 versus parent 3/12 and context-disabled 7/12. The older
phrase-start challenge passes 8/8. Selection was saved before all twelve fresh
answers passed after source eviction. All 663 retained construction answers,
forward/reverse turns, 28/28 long-window and 48/48 dependent reads, prior span
panels and other selected preservation pass. Preserve the stopped preparation,
`cc766ed9`, `0e1914c4` and `af997b17` negatives. Open feedback informed
construction design; the older shape candidate's separate eight fresh cases
remain unopened. Complete supplied construction remains 50/52 because two
upstream `quiet river` writes are absent; they are explicitly outside the
supported selector population.

Actual-artifact malformed root/registry/parent rejection, exact parent retention,
roundtrip, per-step checkpoints and zero-allocation ingestion/emission pass.
The root CLI emits ` Cobalt Field.\n` with EOS for the earlier failed
`Report notes Cobalt Field` case. Sampled load time is 14.652 seconds,
short/evicted ingestion plus response-start is 0.181–0.486 ms, and maximum
predict/observe is 0.175 ms across 67 samples. These are distinct scopes and no
energy or broad latency advantage is established. Studio/WASM/HTTP integration
of this artifact remains `NOT_RUN`.

**Next: repair learned writer support, then shared causal transitions.** The
preserved `quiet river` trace has no write before start selection. Source and
stored weights show `quiet` moving from masked payload to preceding context
removes three action-1 score points; this diagnosis still needs an intervention.
Use a parent-preserving writer refinement with newly authored cross-owner
payload/context contrasts and updated NoWrite cache binding. Keep accepted
start/reader/emitter behavior fixed. Then implement a bounded shared transition
where the second operator consumes the actual first committed result—for example,
Add→Add with the first write ID in the second derivation. Do not equate unrelated
copied text plus arithmetic with causal composition. #1139, #1140 and #973 remain
open; this result does not establish general phrase understanding or language.

This cycle charged 483.207 model seconds, including the preparation stop,
four candidates, comparisons, controls, preservation and artifact/CLI checks.
The current CLI also loads the older shape-only artifact and preserves its
opened Amber Meadow output.
Cumulative use is 4,870.743/4,950 seconds; 79.257 seconds remain. All extensions
were recorded before use under standing owner authorization. The broad storage
ceiling is 8,069,840,896 bytes with the 128 MiB stop margin preserved. Complete
projections, engineering commands, storage samples and all prior charges are
linked in the evidence. No unique material was deleted and no external paid
compute was used. Project the entire successor before execution.

## Learned relation starts — transfer negative, 2026-09-07

**Keep `321e990f` as the retained model.** The implemented
[learned start selector](../native_geometric_relation_start_1140.md) produces
candidate `bb6b8ba4`: construction improves 2/8 to 8/8 and open development
2/8 to 6/8. All 663 retained construction answers, earlier forward/reverse
sessions, long-window/dependent reads and selected preservation pass. Complete
parent parameters are unchanged. Selection requires all eight open answers;
it failed, so fresh cases and post-selection diagnostics remain `NOT_RUN`.
The candidate and its exact failures are preserved, not promoted.

The twenty-code, two-lane H4 fit changed only predecessor-shape codes. In
`A ledger says Pearl Cove holds tesvi`, both `says` and `Pearl` follow
lowercase words. Their learned states tie and the longer candidate wins,
producing ` says Pearl Cove.\n`. Construction offered no contrast to reject
that shortcut. This is a learned representation-use failure, with the correct
value still admitted; it is not missing value storage or evidence against the
whole geometric architecture.

**Next: extend phrase-start selection with bounded ordered lexical/prime and role context plus contrasting construction data.** The [post-result direction review](model-direction-2026-09.md) identifies both a learned predecessor-shape shortcut and a source-derived conditional feature alias for lowercase multiword starts. Better contrasts alone cannot separate identical shape features. Reuse the successful original-source-cue pair mechanism from `419ba3a7`, exact predecessor records, writer context and the existing H4 learner. Preserve endpoint/admission/payload/version behavior and parent parameters. Open failures remain development evidence; the authored fresh panel remains unexecuted. Measure complete answers, preservation and a context-disabled control. This is the immediate #1139 slice before reusable shared transitions/emission under #1140; general language integration remains #973. No new model execution accompanies this recommendation. Wider separators remain a separate representation limitation. The cycle used 60.167 seconds of model work;
cumulative use is 4,387.536/4,410 seconds, leaving 22.464 seconds with no
ceiling increase. A complete repeat of this 60-second cycle does not fit that
balance; project the full next work and sufficient authorized resources before
execution. Necessary local extensions remain preauthorized by the owner: record the complete projection, reason, increment and updated cumulative limit before use, preserving the storage stop margin. Do not ask to reconfirm that standing authorization. No external compute or cleanup occurred.

## Reverse relation endpoints — 2026-09-07

**Retain `321e990f` at bounded reverse-value scope.** The
[result](../native_geometric_reverse_spans_1140.md) and
[evidence](../evidence/native_geometric_reverse_spans_1140.json) record reuse of
the existing learned writer endpoint and H4 continuation operator. The full
`0b12b604` parent is fixed; no fit is added. Earlier starts must reach the
selected final value word exactly. The selected word keeps its identity, with
the earlier start retained separately; linker/owner words cannot enter the value.

Construction improves 3/6 to 6/6; open turns pass 6/6, short reads 3/3 and fresh
turns after selection 6/6. All 663 prior construction answers, all 18 earlier
forward session turns, 28/28 long-window and 48/48 dependent reads, prior
source-span panels and other selected preservation pass. Actual-artifact
parent/start rejection, anchor preservation, checkpoints and zero-allocation
checks pass. Kernel maximum 0.152 ms excludes loading/input/checkpoint host work;
energy remains unmeasured. Root CLI and Studio are `NOT_RUN` for this artifact.

**Next: learn phrase-start selection instead of longest admitted prefix.**
The plain-introduction and two-space diagnostics remain 0/2, with no retry on
those opened cases. Start selection and exact separator representation are
separate missing pieces. Use new construction/open contrasts and preserve the
opened diagnostics. The owner-directed cycle explicitly added 120 seconds to
the cumulative ceiling (4,290 to 4,410); actual model work was 43.770 seconds.
Cumulative use is 4,327.369/4,410, leaving 82.631 seconds. Project the complete
successor before execution; no global timer reset or external compute occurred.

## Retained multiword relation values — 2026-09-07

**Retain `0b12b604` with the corrected forward-only runtime.** The
[result](../native_geometric_retained_spans_1140.md) and
[evidence](../evidence/native_geometric_retained_spans_1140.json) bind the runtime
source and artifact separately. All `419ba3a7` parameters remain unchanged; no fit
was needed. The accepted H4 Continue/Finish operator now accumulates a bounded
forward value during input and commits its complete bytes as one immutable
relation version. Later reads survive raw-window eviction. Same-prefix values
conflict correctly; explicit revision clears the conflict.

Parent construction is 0/6; corrected construction and open sessions are 6/6
each, and all six previously exposed fresh turns replay correctly. Exact
write/version counts and isolation pass. All 663 retained construction answers,
14/14, 6/6 and 9/9 prior span panels, 28/28 long-window answers and all other
preservation pass. The initial runtime overextended two reverse statements and
was rejected at 26/28 long-window preservation. That negative is preserved.
Reverse writes now commit their earlier single-word anchor immediately; no
unobserved endpoint is inferred. Both runs use the same artifact bytes, with
different source identities. Initial allocation/checkpoint evidence covers the
unchanged forward path; final behavior is checked on the corrected runtime.

**Next: learn role-aware value endpoints in both source orders**, including
connector/spacing distinctions, with the existing geometric operator and typed
owner/value binding. Reverse multiword values, broad phrase understanding and
general reasoning remain unqualified. Do not tune on the opened fresh panels.
The cycle used 54.294 seconds of model work. Cumulative use is
4,283.599/4,290 seconds, leaving 6.401 seconds with no ceiling increase. A new
model campaign needs a complete resource projection and sufficient authorized
allocation. Root CLI and Studio execution of this artifact are `NOT_RUN`;
this delivery qualifies the native library/probe path. See the evidence for
engineering/storage totals, source hashes and exact execution boundaries.

## Context-sensitive source extent — 2026-09-07

**Retain `419ba3a7` at bounded source-span scope.** The
[result](../native_geometric_span_context_1139.md) and
[evidence](../evidence/native_geometric_span_context_1139.json) record one native
Rust fit. The same signed-H4 Continue/Finish operator consumes separator,
next-word prime and its pair with the original source cue. A twenty-word
construction-only prime registry and eight learned feature codes preserve every
parent parameter and initial source commitment.

Construction improves 5/14 to 14/14, open development 2/6 to 6/6 and fresh 3/9 to
9/9. Removing the source-cue pair gives 11/14, 4/6 and 6/9, reproducing unwanted
`CITY holds OWNER` continuation. All 663 retained construction answers and the
earlier 24/24 set are preserved, repairing the twenty separator-only losses.
All other output/write/session preservation passes. The new artifact is
11,631,370 bytes; `c6a98c04` remains its parent and `7e928bd2` remains a preserved
negative, not the active model.

The unseen-connector and double-space diagnostics still fail 0/2. Qualification
is familiar-template source-extent selection, not general phrase understanding.
Actual parent/mutation, causal commit, checkpoint and zero-allocation checks
pass. Warm continuation maximum is 0.146 ms, excluding first source selection,
load, encoding, ingestion and checkpoints; energy remains unmeasured.

**Next: retain bounded multiword relation values across writes, window eviction
and later reads**, carrying the accepted exact extent and separators. Use
independently authored construction/open session examples;
do not fit on this fresh diagnostic. Keep the source/numeric path fixed and
preserve prior behavior. Refresh the cumulative resource projection before
execution. This cycle explicitly adds 120 seconds to the cumulative model ceiling
(4,170 to 4,290), with 120-second model, 900-second engineering and 40 MiB growth
caps. Model work is 73.059 seconds; cumulative 4,229.305/4,290 leaves 60.695
seconds. Public CLI generation passes. Its build required a recorded storage stop
and narrow compiler-cache cleanup; the evidence preserves the sampled overshoot
and all engineering costs. All models, data and prior evidence remain intact.

## Previous separator-only source-span experiment — 2026-09-07

**Keep `c6a98c04` active; do not promote `7e928bd2`.** The
[result](../native_geometric_source_span_1139.md) and
[evidence](../evidence/native_geometric_source_span_1139.json) record the completed
Rust source-span extension. The existing signed-H4 learner chooses Continue or
Finish over exact separators; the causal cursor copies adjacent frozen source
words with an extended total span capped at 28 bytes within the 32-step limit.
All parent parameters and the initial source commitment are preserved.

Construction improves 2/5 to 5/5, exposed open answers 1/6 to 6/6, and the separate
fresh diagnostic 3/10 to 9/10 versus the disabled extension. However, retained
construction falls from 663/663 to 647/663 and an earlier exposed set from 24/24
to 20/24: `Rome holds ada` is copied whole instead of `Rome`. The explicit
same-space phrase-boundary check fails 0/1; the double-space fresh value also
truncates. Other numeric, literal, identifier, relation, dependent and session
preservation passes. This is a useful transport implementation and a negative
selection result, not a replacement for the active checkpoint.

**Next: context-sensitive source extent.** Reuse candidate-owned ordered source
identity and query/value binding in the same Continue/Finish operator, with new
construction/open pairs that require both stopping and continuing at the same
separator. Keep first-source selection fixed; a separator-only refit or a larger
page table cannot resolve the observed feature collision. Preserve the complete
negative and project all new work against the cumulative budget before execution.
Do not use the just-opened fresh diagnostic to tune that successor.
Model work is 83.477 seconds; cumulative 4156.246/4170 leaves 13.754 seconds.
Growth at verification is 66,879,488 bytes inside 96 MiB. Actual candidate
lineage, interruption, every-byte checkpoint and zero-allocation checks pass.
Twenty-eight uncached continuation steps have maximum 0.146 ms, excluding first
source selection, loading, ingestion and checkpoints; energy is unmeasured.

## Candidate-owned source context — #1139 / #1140, 2026-09-07

**Retain `c6a98c04` at bounded source-owner/NoRead selection scope.** The
[result](../native_geometric_source_context_1139.md) and
[evidence](../evidence/native_geometric_source_context_1139.json) bind the actual
Rust implementation. Four exact predecessor identities travel with each retained
word, preserving owner context after it leaves the shared sixteen-word window.
The same learned signed-H4 source selector consumes that information. An outer
witness reconstructs the complete `e1ef0a5d` parent; numeric, admission, relation,
dependent-read and emission parameters are fixed.

Complete construction improves **654/663 to 663/663**, with nine gains and no
lost correct answer; the original 631 now pass 631/631. Open answers improve
**12/16 to 16/16**. Fresh owner/query/name/place/order answers improve **24/32 to
32/32**, versus 24/32 with retained context disabled. The exact-parent control
restores every parent construction text/stop. Both earlier admission location
errors are repaired (12/12), and all prior literal, source, computation, relation
and session preservation passes. The question family remains familiar.

Initial retained-context selection already passes 428/428 eligible choices before
one margin-improving code update. Existing learned owner-binding codes were
unreachable from the old feature window; they now receive preserved identity.
This is not a new angular-versus-equality, broad language or frontier result.
Actual artifact lineage/mutation, causal commitment, checkpoint and zero-allocation
checks pass, along with focused state tests and native kernel/policy checks.
Seventeen warm steps measure median 0.136 ms/max 0.184 ms, excluding load, encoding,
ingestion and checkpoints; no end-to-end or energy claim follows.

Model work consumes 60.834 seconds; cumulative 4072.769/4170 seconds leaves 97.231 seconds.
Artifact JSON is 11,626,472 bytes; total sampled growth remains inside 256 MiB.
No extension, external compute or deletion occurred. All earlier material remains.

**Next: reusable contextual transitions and emission conditioned on the selected
exact entity/value and committed operator result**, through the same native path.
Preserve these source/numeric boundaries and use new construction/open/fresh
populations; do not tune on the just-opened 32 cases. Refresh a complete resource
projection against the remaining time/storage before executing that successor.

## Previous checkpoint: order-robust literal operand selection — #1139 / #1140, 2026-09-07

**Retain `e1ef0a5d` at bounded literal operand-selection scope.** The
[result](../native_geometric_literal_binding_1139.md) and
[evidence](../evidence/native_geometric_literal_binding_1139.json) bind the actual
Rust continuation. The existing literal router retains its dictionary and feature
law, adds all 52 observed missing codes to the prior 567, and learns exact
query-to-cue binding through the same signed-H4 fold. Every other parameter is
fixed; an explicit witness reconstructs the complete `433e3807` parent.

Complete construction improves **571/631 to 630/631**, with 59 gains and no lost
correct answer. Disabling refinement restores every parent answer. Open answers
improve **4/8 to 8/8**; fresh name/value/place/order answers improve **8/16 to
16/16**, versus **8/16** for matched equality. Both fits finish their schedule.
The original 615 construction cases improve 563/615 to 614/615. The remaining
construction error is a supported-location abstention. The previous admission
set improves 8/12 to 10/12; its two location errors remain. All prior output,
relation-write and session preservation passes, including both source/NoRead sets.

Thirty-two repaired Rust continuations compile and execute their assertions.
Actual parent/mutation, causal commitment, checkpoint and zero-allocation checks
pass, and the rebuilt public CLI returns the correct reordered fresh value.
Eighteen warm prediction/observation samples measure median 0.120 ms and maximum
0.216 ms, excluding loading, encoding, ingestion and checkpoints. No end-to-end,
energy, general-language or frontier capability follows. Artifact size is
11,519,373 bytes. Model work totals 242.829 seconds and engineering 637.694
seconds; cumulative model use is 4011.935/4170 seconds, leaving 158.065 seconds.
Sampled storage growth is 298,889,216 bytes within the 384 MiB cap. No budget
extension, external compute or deletion occurred. All prior material remains.

**Next: order-robust supported-source/NoRead selection** using the existing source
router and exact occurrence metadata, preserving this literal binding and memory.
The surviving location errors provide the concrete starting point. Use new
construction/development and fresh cases; do not tune on the just-opened sixteen.
Refresh the full remaining resource projection before another run.

## Previous checkpoint: literal numeric admission — #1139 / #1140, 2026-09-07 UTC

**Retain `433e3807` as a bounded construction admission repair.** The
[result](../native_geometric_joint_admission_1139.md) and
[evidence](../evidence/native_geometric_joint_admission_1139.json) bind the actual
Rust implementation and fitted artifact. A two-lane signed-H4 gate decides
Numeric or DeferToLexical before literal payload execution, preserving every
`d59070c2` parent parameter, computed-role behavior and the source/NoRead path.
Construction improves 558/615 to 563/615 with no lost correct or changed remaining
wrong answer. All five gains revert when the gate is disabled. Three repaired
Rust identity completions compile and pass fifteen assertions.

Open answers stay 4/6; first-use answers stay 8/12, identical to parent and matched
equality. The fresh set exercises numeric admission but no lexical rejection;
there is no new rejection-transfer or angular-advantage result. All prior output,
write and session preservation passes, including the prior 20/20 source set.
Actual parent/mutation, causal commitment, checkpoint, overflow and allocation
checks pass. Eighteen warm prediction/observation samples have median 0.133 ms
and maximum 0.182 ms, excluding loading, encoding, ingestion and checkpoints;
energy and end-to-end latency remain unmeasured.

**Next: repair order-sensitive entity-to-operand binding in the existing literal
selector**, starting from retained wrong-entity copies and exact occurrence
metadata. Keep the separate reversed-order source/NoRead negatives. Do not refit
on the just-opened first-use set. This step consumed 163.480 seconds of model
work; cumulative 3769.106/4170 seconds leaves 400.894 seconds, without extending
the limit. The artifact is 11,397,442 bytes. All parents and evidence remain.
Refresh the full resource projection before the next run. See the result for
precise scope, engineering/storage costs and checks actually executed.

## Owner-requested architecture review — 2026-09-06

The [source reconciliation](architecture-2026-09/README.md) covers discovered
engine families, original angular/prime routing, mathematical and RH histories,
UOR/Prism/matmul, NEMESIS, W33, GoldSnnail, GNAF, SpiralCore and the separate
Studio. It is a read-only model/evidence review, with no new fit or capability
result. It records allowed geometric address/page lookup, no serving matrix
products, and the later conditional allowance for expert gates. Offline Rust
training matmul remains permitted. Fibers and explicit vector-bundle/frame
transport remain reusable mechanisms at their declared typed boundaries.

PR #1160 merged at `aa841309`; its tree equals reviewed head `05f265ad`.
At the review date, d59070c2 and every parent were retained. Its proposed next
implementation was a joint numeric/word/NoRead decision before execution, preserving separate NoOperation
and NoRead semantics, then reusable contextual transitions and emission. The
review gave a preliminary resource envelope; the implementation above completed
the cumulative projection before execution. Broader language and API capability
precede the actual native-model integration into the GitHub Pages Studio.

## Supported-source versus NoRead selection — #1139 / #1140, 2026-09-06

**Retain `d59070c2` at bounded joint source/action selection scope.** The
[result](../native_geometric_source_noread_1139.md) and
[evidence](../evidence/native_geometric_source_noread_1139.json) bind the executed
Rust refinement. It replaces the existing router, warm-starting64 inherited
codes and admitting64 construction features. Eight code updates achieve384/384
eligible selection targets. A nonexecuting previous-router witness reconstructs
exact `e7c14c99`; all descendant parameters and original parent CIDs remain
unchanged. No extra serving head, session state, query parser or provider is added.

Fresh complete generation improves14/20 to20/20 versus10/20 matched exact-code;
all20 cases use the direct router. Open generation is14/14. Combined construction
improves545/603 to551/603 with no lost correct case, and all52 remaining wrong
outputs equal the parent. Both earlier literal sets are16/16 and their103-case
construction now passes. Both16-case computation sets,8 identifiers,58 computed
construction,6 numerics,three12-case role sets,48 dependent answers/writes,
62 prior responses,24 transfers,28 exposed-name answers/writes,28 long-context
answers/writes and5 persistent turns remain correct.

Four focused tests and actual source/NoRead plus three-turn zero-allocation
checks pass, including observation-only commit, mutation rejection and checkpoint
restoration. Actual CLI abstention and supported copying are recorded in the
result. Prior generated-Rust assertions were not rerun; identifier output bytes
are preserved. The artifact grows91,677 bytes to11,304,530. Routing work increases;
correct termination reduces complete-population work. No per-token speedup or
general syntax/prose/reasoning/frontier capability follows.

**Next: joint numerical-versus-word admission at the existing operator boundary.**
A supported-location construction case about cyra still emits13 instead of Paris
through inherited numeric selection; three earlier identifier prompts also emit
numbers. Preserve computed roles and this source/NoRead repair while learning
that choice, then resume broader #1139 routed-block/#1140 composition requirements.
Both issues remain open. No new suffix-head or cache campaign is justified.

PR #1159 merged at `be32b410`; this successor uses its identical source tree.
The shared model ceiling was extended600s to4170s and storage640MiB under standing
owner authorization before execution. Point projections420s model/900s engineering,
cycle ceilings540s/1500s, one model process,4GiB child RSS target and128MiB storage
margin remain enforced. Model work155.350s and engineering524.036s stay below
projection. Cumulative model use3605.626/4170s leaves564.374s. Peak sampled known
storage6,837,837,824 bytes and child RSS1,141,374,976 bytes remain within limits.
All corrections and retained material are charged; no deletion or external model
compute occurred.

## Previous checkpoint: committed NoRead completion in literal contexts — #1139 / #1140, 2026-09-06

**Retain `e7c14c99` at literal-numeric NoRead-completion scope.** The
[result](../native_geometric_no_read_completion_1139.md) and
[evidence](../evidence/native_geometric_no_read_completion_1139.json) bind the
actual native Rust path. A36,763-byte continuation table reuses existing
word-binding prefix features and integer token scoring after selected NoRead
commits. It applies only with retained literal numeric records and no derived
record. The complete `c29ab982` parent and all learned numeric/source parameters
remain unchanged; no session-state field or response provider is added.

Exposed complete answers improve12/16 to14/16 and reserved changed-name/value
answers14/16 to15/16. All 12 new numeric answers and3/4 abstentions pass. The
remaining new failure copies `coins` as a location answer. Complete three-turn
computations stay16/16, identifier returns8/8, and the earlier independent set
16/16. Preservation passes48/48 dependent cases,62/62 earlier responses,24/24
prior transfer,28/28 exposed names,28/28 long-context,5/5 persistent turns,
6/6 earlier numeric, all three12-case role sets and58/58 computed construction.
Thirteen focused tests, actual NoRead and three-turn zero allocations, complete
parent equality, checkpoint and mutation checks pass. Construction is99/103;
four construction cases still choose an unsupported source.

Two intermediate candidates are retained negatives: `760fc57b` shortened four
required explanatory responses; `235fad68` restored62/62 but broke a
relation-conflict session. Their first-use evaluation remained unopened during
revision. The final state-scope correction restores memory behavior without
changing the second candidate's learned table. No new angular-distance
advantage or general abstention capability is established.

**Next: repair joint source/NoRead selection for unsupported retained words.**
Reuse the existing geometric source router and occurrence binding, training
supported-word and missing-attribute cases together. Keep numeric admission,
computed results, copied identifiers and memory preservation. Do not replace
NoOperation with a universal Unknown or add an observed-question parser.
General prose, syntax, reasoning, frontier capability and whole-model laptop
advantage remain unqualified. #1139/#1140 remain open.

The rebuilt actual CLI returns the repaired abstention and the preserved
identifier with EOS. Model work282.150s brings cumulative use to3450.276/3570s,
leaving119.724s. The scoped storage-growth allowance increased160MiB after the
CLI-only build reached its guard; the broad ceiling stays7,063,207,936 bytes.
All build/model failures, corrections and retries remain charged. Exact costs
and the revised engineering projections are in the evidence. No deletions or
external model compute.

## Previous checkpoint: protected computed roles and literal admission — #1139 / #1140, 2026-09-06

**Retain `c29ab982` at bounded literal-admission scope.** The
[result](../native_geometric_literal_admission_1139.md) and
[evidence](../evidence/native_geometric_literal_admission_1139.json) bind execution.
A separate53,653-byte literal table learns Copy/Add/NoOperation while retaining
all inherited `af337c28` fields verbatim. Structural state eligibility selects
which table runs; operator/operand and numeric admission are learned. Serving
continues through integer/table operations without matmul or LLM correction.

New complete three-turn transfer improves12/16 to 16/16, new literal answers8/16
to12/16, and new identifier answers stay8/8. Exact-code matches these new scores:
no new angular advantage. The exposed earlier independent-result set improves
12/16 to 16/16 with no lost correct cases. Prior62/62 and24/24 sets are restored,
with all listed dependent, memory, numeric and role checks preserved. Eight
new identifier-return functions execute24 assertions; this is bounded copying
in familiar Rust forms. Seven focused tests and actual zero-allocation,
checkpoint, parent-equality and artifact checks pass; the rebuilt CLI returns
the identifier rather than a number for the distractor prompt.

**Next: select a supported word answer or coherent abstention after numeric
NoOperation.** Four new abstention texts still fail;103/103 routing targets
therefore yield95/103 full construction responses. Reuse existing answer-entry
and retained-word mechanisms, preserving the new numeric/identifier behavior.
Do not turn NoOperation into a universal canned answer. General prose, syntax,
reasoning, mixed arithmetic-to-prose conversation, frontier capability and
whole-model efficiency remain unqualified. #1139/#1140 remain open.

This cycle charges246.540s model work; cumulative use is3168.126/3210s, leaving
41.874s. A pre-recorded+240s cumulative extension and280s final cycle ceiling
cover the run. No storage allowance increase, deletions or external model
compute. Exact engineering, storage/RSS and all commands are in the evidence.

## Previous checkpoint: literal geometric selection improves numerics but fails preservation — #1139 / #1140, 2026-09-06

**Keep `af337c28` as the accepted artifact.** The optional literal-state
extension is [implemented and measured](../native_geometric_literal_selection_1139.md),
with [bound evidence](../evidence/native_geometric_literal_selection_1139.json).
Angular `51788aef` and matched exact-code `3f31e998` improve new complete
three-turn transfers from8/16 to 16/16 and new literal answers from7/16 to12/16.
The four remaining literal failures are abstention text. Neither candidate is
promoted: both lose a previously correct computed-result case. Angular also
loses three identifier-copy responses, dropping prior sets to60/62 and23/24.
Its old independent-transfer aggregate stays12/16 but masks two lost cases.
There is no new angular advantage over the exact-code control.

The same learned H4 role component can now select literal operands with an
artifact-bound opt-in flag. Full vocabulary retention corrects a diagnosed
256-of601 feature truncation collision. Adding seven actual construction first
prompts corrects a missing-prefix training mismatch. The revised fit reaches
129/129 routing labels but121/129 generated construction responses; fit is not
end-to-end acceptance. Both earlier failures remain preserved. Native serving
continues to use integer/table operations with no matmul, dense transformer or
LLM correction. The real CLI, seven focused tests, kernel source check and an
actual three-turn zero-allocation/checkpoint check pass.

**Next: protect computed-result routing while learning literal numeric admission
against word-answer alternatives.** Reuse existing NoOperation, exact state and
operators, with a bounded literal-state correction rather than shared refitting
that changes working response roles. Check new lexical identity coupling and
individual preservation cases. Do not expand generated Rust until the new
numeric path stops taking over identifier answers. General syntax, prose,
reasoning, frontier capability and whole-model efficiency remain unqualified.

This cycle charges317.230s local model work; cumulative use is2921.586/2970s,
leaving48.414s. It used the pre-recorded+240s cumulative extension and a360s
cycle ceiling. No additional storage allowance, deletions or external model
compute. The linked evidence carries exact engineering totals, storage/RSS,
commands and preserved artifacts; all earlier resource charges remain included.

## Previous checkpoint: independent computed-result selection — #1139 / #1140, 2026-09-06

**Retain `af337c28` at bounded operand-provenance scope.** The
[result](../native_geometric_operand_provenance_1139.md) and
[evidence](../evidence/native_geometric_operand_provenance_1139.json) bind the
selected artifact, negative attempts and complete resource accounting.
Continuing the working role parameters by exact word-identity remapping gives
58/58 construction generation,8/8 reachable development and 12/16 predeclared
name/number/computation-order transfers, versus 3/16 for `43c54db3`.
The matched exact-code continuation also gets 12/16; no angular-distance
advantage over that control is established here.

All 12 trajectories that generate their required intermediates select the named
result correctly, including changed names and reversed computation order.
Four failures occur at the first literal answer, before the new selector runs.
The21,758-byte role component adds query/cue matches propagated through exact
operand IDs. It preserves numeric payloads, signed-H4 learned selection,
canonical Copy identity, query boundaries and selected integer execution.
No serving matmul, dense transformer or LLM/provider correction is added.

Prior conversation, memory, numeric/role and familiar generated Rust behavior
is preserved at the scopes in the record. Removing the requested intermediate
gives 0/8 full provenance successes but2/8 correct texts through recomputation.
Two random-initialization candidates lose18 prior updated-total cases; neither
is accepted. Reversed literal-order and first-name-pair failures remain exposed.

**Next: geometric selection for literal-only first answers.** Extend the same
query/cue operand/operator mechanism to the older sparse initial-answer path;
start with the exposed failures, preserve this learned continuation, and test
complete unseen-name/order trajectories before generated Rust expansion.
General syntax/prose/reasoning, frontier capability and whole-model laptop
performance remain unqualified. #1139/#1140 remain open.

This cycle charges 287.845s model work and approximately 14 minutes of monitored
engineering within360/900s cycle ceilings. Cumulative model use is 2604.356/2730s,
leaving 125.644s. Standing authorization extended the model ceiling by 360s and
storage by 192 MiB before execution. Peak sampled known storage6,484,525,056
bytes remains below the effective6,707,802,112-byte ceiling. No deletions or
external model compute. Exact engineering totals, checks and retained artifact
paths are in the linked evidence; all earlier charges remain carried forward.

## Previous checkpoint: learned geometric typed selection passes its bounded transfer — #1139, 2026-09-06

**Retain `bb79456b` over exact parent `2600b95b`.** The
[result](../native_geometric_typed_routing_1139.md#executed-result--2026-09-06)
and [evidence](../evidence/native_geometric_typed_routing_1139.json) bind scope.
A learned signed-H4 query/operand selector now chooses Copy, Add or NoOperation
before the existing exact execution and derived-value commit. Its optional
case-folded query metadata component is 13,865 serialized bytes; no serving LLM,
dense attention, matrix multiplication or floating-point projection is added.

Angular generates 42/42 construction,6/6 exposed development and 6/6 new authored
numeric/wording transfers, versus 3/6 new transfers for the matched exact-code
fit. Removing the intermediate yields0/6. An earlier exact-case version failed
3/6 transfer and remains preserved; its repaired cases are explicitly exposed.
The new checks use small authored cases after design selection, not sealed general
language.19+12 ->31 now supports repeat ->31 and add5 ->36, using its own result.

All 48/48 dependent,62/62 earlier,24/24 prior-transfer,28/28 exposed-name,28/28
long-context and 5/5 persistent checks pass. Seven focused tests, the kernel
source check, actual typed zero-allocation check, CLI revision and four unchanged
generated Rust functions with 12 semantic assertions pass. No new general Rust
reasoning, syntax, prose, frontier capability or whole-model speed is established.

**Next: role-sensitive selection among competing intermediate results.** Vary
which derived result is requested and their order, inspect role features, and
learn the same joint choice against the observed failure. The current recency-
based metadata is insufficient evidence of general binding. Reuse exact state,
operators and the existing learner; no new cache/store campaign. Full #1139 and
#1140 remain open at their broader acceptance scope.

This cycle uses 162.033 seconds of local model work and 686.095 seconds of monitored
engineering work. Cumulative model use is 2033.039/2130 seconds, with 96.961 seconds
remaining. Recorded extensions are+240 model seconds and+128MiB storage under the
owner's standing authorization. All material is preserved; paid external compute
is zero. Source and delivery state are recorded through the protected PR.

## Previous checkpoint: selected execution passes; learned composition fails — #1139, 2026-09-06

**Retain `2600b95b` with the checked selected-execution runtime.** The
[result](../native_geometric_typed_admission_1139.md#executed-result--2026-09-06)
and [evidence](../evidence/native_geometric_typed_admission_1139.json) preserve
**3/3 exact initial sums but 0/6 correct follow-ups**. All required literals and
actual derived sums remain captured. Repeat instructions wrongly add an old
operand to the sum; removing the derived record changes that output. Add-new-
value instructions abstain. This is a valid OPEN operator/operand selection
negative, not missing storage, unavailable execution or general language evidence.

The runtime now scores the existing typed candidates before executing selected
Copy/Add, preserving overflow fallback and exact commit semantics. Its existing
sparse scorer is unchanged; no newly learned angular typed selector is claimed.
Same-artifact pre-change/rebuilt executions preserve 48/48 dependent, 62/62
prior, 24/24 transfer, 28/28 exposed-name and 5/5 persistent cases. The 28 longer-
context answers/writes also pass with identical generation objects except work.
Six focused causal/cache/counter tests, numeric and actual-artifact allocation
checks, the CLI revision answer and four unchanged generated Rust functions with
12 semantic assertions pass. On the 62-case set, additions fall 236 to 16;
feature comparisons remain 272,116. No whole-model speedup is established.

**Next: learn query-conditioned geometric operator/operand choice over literal
and derived references.** Reuse the signed-H4 source-routing learner and existing
exact execution/commit path, train the joint candidate/action decision on
causally generated intermediate states, and inspect actual query features before
fit to avoid the earlier indistinguishable-input failure. The six exposed
negatives are development data; new wording/composition evaluation follows
selection. This was the next change at that checkpoint; it is now implemented above. No new store or cache
campaign is warranted by these retained-but-misselected values.

The owner now authorizes necessary project-resource extensions. Record explicit
projections and increments without asking for the same authorization again.
This evaluation used 74.262 seconds after recorded +60 and +30 second increments;
cumulative model use is 1871.006/1890 seconds. The diagnostic's unoptimized build
exceeded its initial time projection; its negative was not rerun. Storage stayed
within the existing allowance, material is preserved and paid external compute
is zero. Protected delivery is PR #1153; the full #1139/#1140 handoffs remain unmet.

## Corrected-writer NoWrite reuse — #1139, 2026-09-06

**Retain `2600b95b`; the NoWrite compute regression is repaired.** The
[record](../native_geometric_writer_admission_1139.md) and
[evidence](../evidence/native_geometric_writer_admission_1139.json) bind scope.
The unchanged `8dbf1367` writer now uses its own exact cache. Compilation retains
140 observed certified negatives plus one independently certified phase of an
exactly periodic construction window, within a fixed 256-entry bound. No writer,
reader, tokenizer or payload/version parameter is refit.

On the same 28 long-context prompts, exact skips are **21,799/21,907** and writer
row comparisons fall **226,101,330 → 539,448**. Complete answers, writes, token
IDs, geometric state and copy/entry traces are unchanged. All **48/48** dependent,
**62/62** prior, **24/24** transfer, **28/28** exposed-name, **28/28** long-context
and **5/5** persistent-session checks pass. Four unchanged generated Rust
functions recompile and pass twelve assertions; eight focused tests pass.
The initial 64-entry and 140-entry partial repairs remain preserved. The
140-entry allocation census is zero with identical serving code; a dedicated
final-artifact allocation rerun and final CLI invocation are NOT_RUN.

**Immediate next: selected typed operator execution and derived-value use.**
Reuse existing exact operators, learn admission/operand choice before execution,
commit one derived value, and use it in a subsequent decision. Further cache
tuning is secondary. This repair establishes exact reuse, not new geometric
semantic advantage, general language or frontier capability. Full #1139/#1140
handoffs remain unmet. Cumulative model use is **1796.744/1800 seconds**; only
**3.256 seconds** remain. Prepare the complete next build/fit/evaluation
projection and obtain only any genuinely missing cumulative-budget allowance.
Necessary incremental storage remains preauthorized; all material is preserved.

## Learned writer binding — previous checkpoint, #1139, 2026-09-06

**Retain `8dbf1367` as a functional development improvement; preserve `8070c006`
as the reader/cost comparator.** The [writer record](../native_geometric_writer_binding_1139.md)
and [evidence](../evidence/native_geometric_writer_binding_1139.json) bind the scope.
A construction-only cue vocabulary and the existing sparse integer writer
learner now select exact owner/value/action writes without importing payload
spelling as a cue. Tokenization, reader parameters, exact records, version
semantics and copying remain fixed; no runtime matrix operation is added.

The final continuation artifact gets **48/48** dependent answers and exact writes,
**62/62** earlier answers, **24/24** transfer, **28/28** long-context answers/writes
and **5/5** persistent-session turns. A replacement reserved-name set gets
**28/28** answers/writes after selection. Four unchanged generated Rust functions
compile and pass 12 semantic assertions; actual-artifact copying is allocation
free. The broader owner-of-box question still returns Unknown. Three earlier
attempts and an accidentally opened evaluation set are preserved as development
evidence, not relabeled as final qualification.

**Historical successor, now executed above:** restore exact NoWrite reuse.
At this checkpoint the new cue namespace made all 21,907 long-context admission
queries fall through, raising writer row comparisons from 580,944 to
226,101,330. The later cache repair preserves the functional improvement and
removes that regression; this earlier measurement remains valid for `8dbf1367`.

## Geometric dependent source read — #1139, 2026-09-06

**Retain angular `8070c006` for the next development step, with `55e602a0`
and `067adbf0` preserved as frozen comparators.** The
[dependent-source record](../native_geometric_dependent_source_1139.md) and
[evidence](../evidence/native_geometric_dependent_source_1139.json) bind the scope.
A learned signed-H4 source/operator choice now follows one exact relation value
as the owner key of a second record, then copies that record's bytes. Both
current version IDs persist through observed copying and restoration. There is
no second similarity scorer, grammar parser, new memory store or runtime matrix
operation. Startup validation still uses floating point.

On 48 authored OPEN changed-name cases, angular answers **40/48**, exact-code
selection **32/48**, and the parent **20/48**. Disabling the intermediate lookup
returns **20/48**; disabling routing codes returns **16/48** (that control also
changes the inherited recent-source selector). Both fits preserve **62/62**
earlier responses and **24/24** earlier transfer. Angular succeeds on all four
matched first-edge pairs and all four dependent Rust completion texts; the
unchanged generated functions compile and pass 12 semantic assertions. It also
preserves 28/28 longer-context answers/writes and 5/5 persistent-session turns.
The actual dependent ingest/select/copy path measures zero allocations. The
same two-pass search has 356 reachable construction frames out of 528 documents:
160 bypassed upstream and 12 unreachable through the frozen writer. Angular fits
356/356; exact-code fits 350/356. No run reaches its fit time cap.

The eight development failures all involve failed revision ingestion. Retained
snapshots show some `Now … in …` text writing under `Now` or marking the wrong
relation conflicted; question text can create spurious `Question` records.
The broader owner-of-box question still returns `Unknown`. These are
limitations of the unchanged learned writer, not lost second-read
payloads. The first attempt and its corrected unreachable-target accounting
remain separately preserved. No sealed general-language, broader operator,
frontier capability or whole-model speedup is established.

**Historical successor, now executed above:** repair learned revision-owner binding and NoWrite on
question text in the current writer. Preserve the new dependent reader, exact
identity/version semantics and previous one-read behavior. Use the observed
revision failures and a small fresh-name check before expanding depth or corpus.
#1140 remains subsequent broader typed composition, not completed by these cases.

## Previous retained-source baseline — #1139, 2026-09-06

**Retain angular `55e602a0` for the next source-routing development step;
keep `067adbf0` as the frozen working comparator.** The
[source-routing record](../native_geometric_source_routing_1139.md) and
[evidence](../evidence/native_geometric_source_routing_1139.json) bind this result.
Two learned signed H4 states now select an existing exact recent-word reference
and Copy/NoRead action; the causal operator emits that reference's bytes.
It fits source choice without refitting the accepted reader or memorizing answer
strings in a token classifier. Persistent relation reads keep their old priority.

Initial angular selection preserves 61/62 responses and gets 21/24 changed-name
cases. A causal first-selection control repairs a retained-but-rejected Talven
source by suppressing inherited word-path/zeta scoring features. The localized
`role_context_only` fit retains learned H4 composition but keeps those inherited
features out of this binding decision. It reaches 320/320 construction choices,
62/62 earlier responses, 24/24 earlier transfer and 24/24 changed-name cases.
Matched exact-code selection reaches 152/320 construction, 36/62 preservation
and 10/24 on each transfer population; disabling learned codes gets 4/24 fresh.
Both fits complete the same two-pass search schedule. This is one bounded OPEN
development result, not general angular superiority or sealed qualification.

The final angular artifact also preserves 28/28 longer-context relation answers
and writes, and 5/5 persistent-session turns with restore/isolation checks.
Actual CLI generation copies the unseen Rust identifier `packet_input`; the
exact generated function compiles and passes three semantic inputs without
repair. Both the owner-of-the-box question and two arithmetic operations still
return `Unknown`. Source access is useful; dependent reasoning is not qualified.

New routing costs on 24 fresh responses are 18,298 comparisons, 10,994 table
reads and 348,904 logical operand bytes. Existing word-reader row comparisons
fall from 141,490 to 10,710. Same-byte whole-response samples remain about
23.4–23.6 ms; no whole-model speedup is established. The full artifact is
10,797,015 bytes and retains the frozen comparator. Startup validation still
uses floating point; changed serving uses integer/table operations.

**Historical successor, now executed above:** let a selected exact entity/reference condition one
second relation read, retaining both references and using the existing committed
copy operator for the final value. Train the source and operator choices on
short two-link prose/Rust cases and preserve this working one-read behavior.
Do not add another recent-token output classifier, metric sweep, memory store
or broad corpus campaign. #1140's broader multi-operation handoff remains
subsequent. Final held-out evaluation remains NOT_RUN.

Artifacts are under `.uor-models/native-typed-value-2026-09-05/source-routing-*`.
The initial and revised artifacts, including both exact-code negatives, remain
preserved. Final local/CI checks and cumulative resources are recorded in the
linked evidence and protected PR; refresh the shared ledger before new work.

## Dependent geometric reads — #1139, 2026-09-06

**Implemented and exercised; generation/preservation negative. Keep accepted
parent `067adbf0`.** The [routing record](../native_geometric_learned_routing_1139.md#dependent-read-result--2026-09-06)
and [compact evidence](../evidence/native_geometric_recurrent_routing_1139.json)
bind the two dependent H4 reads and shared Base/Emit/EOS output. The first
selected value changes the second query. Both signed results survive until
output, but each read still sees only eight recent raw tokens, and each initial
query compresses the last two tokens. Exact retained words/relations are not
sources for this new block; their older mechanisms still execute separately.

On the same 735 authored OPEN positions, parent gets 45 correct, recurrent
angular 120 and recurrent exact-code selection 144. Angular falls to 53 with
the intermediate connection disabled and 118 with selected actions disabled.
This establishes sensitivity, not angular advantage or useful composition.
All eight continuations fail; angular preserves 6/62 earlier responses and
exact-code selection 0/62. Both generated Rust continuations fail compilation.
The unchanged parent still answers 62/62; disabling the new block reproduces
all complete Generation objects except the declared control label.

A subsequent three-prompt first-decision check finds identical eight-token
inputs, both complete routes, parent winner and all joint-output flags for
arithmetic, relation and color questions requiring `14`, `Rome` and `blue`.
The current feature map cannot distinguish these tasks at the first emitted
token. Score tuning over the same inputs cannot repair that collision.

**Next: connect learned routing to exact retained source references and payload
operators, before tuning another metric or adding route depth.** Reuse the
existing role-aware query features, word occurrences, relation references and
committed-copy interface. Keep exact payload identity through selection; H4
summaries choose access and transport, not replacement answer strings. Use the accepted role-reader as the working source/NoRead comparator; train
the new geometric selector over that existing bounded population and check
new names/values plus old preservation. Do not rebuild or refit the accepted
reader simply to repeat its completed handoff. Only then add a second dependent read
of a selected relation or an intermediate value. This addresses an explicit
source-access limitation; it is not a claim that source access alone solves
language learning. No broad tokenizer/corpus/compiler rewrite or new harness
is needed to start. #1139 remains active; #1140 remains subsequent.

Artifacts are under `.uor-models/native-typed-value-2026-09-05/recurrent-routing-*`.
Corrected angular is `cd39e57d`, exact-code selection `503f9241`; neither is
promoted. The first conditional attempt and its replay-label error are preserved.
Corrected allocation and kernel-source checks pass, as do artifact reload and
actual CLI reproduction at their stated scopes. Protected CI passes 124 native unit,
3 context, 8 allocation and 20 CLI tests at unchanged Rust source `c36720f9`.
PR #1148 owns current-head documentation and merge-queue status.
Model use including the first-decision check is 35.844/120 seconds this cycle,
cumulative 1,446.496/1,800 seconds, leaving 353.504. Engineering through the corrected
kernel check is 1,128.504/1,200 seconds. The storage sample is 5,899,120,640 bytes
with about 195 MiB before the existing tighter stop. No storage increase,
deletion or paid compute was needed. Refresh final receipts before new work.

## First learned routing block — prior checkpoint, 2026-09-05 local date

**Implemented and exercised; development only. Retain accepted parent
`067adbf0`.** The [new record](../native_geometric_learned_routing_1139.md)
describes two learned H4 channels in `Model::predict`: ordered contextual query,
bounded source selection, selected value transport, query-conditioned action
and sparse token readout. Rust fitting executes the actual discrete route.
Prediction uses integer/table operations and passes its allocation/source checks.
The existing geometry, typed values, relation store and committed copy path remain.

On 735 authored OPEN prose/Rust next-token positions, parent gets 45 correct,
learned angular 182, exact-code selection 223 and fixed placement 177. Both
source selection and the learned action affect accuracy, but angular advantage
is not established. Much of this population uses byte fallback. All eight
target continuations fail. Both fitted selectors retain only 38/62 older exact
responses; parent reproduces all 62 complete Generation objects. Both preserve
28/28 relation writes/restored states, while angular returns 16/28 answers and
exact-code selection 28/28. No fitted block is promoted.

**Then-next within #1139: train complete response dispatch and stopping together
with routed prediction against actual final output.** The old response-entry
head can force `Unknown` by adding a positive margin above Base; disabling it
removes that prefix but leaves incoherent generation. The new independent
conditional scores also disrupt EOS. Use ordinary prose/Rust continuations
and the known memory cases to train/check this integration before increasing
context or adding another abstraction stage. Keep the matched selector
comparison. #1139 stays open and #1140 stays subsequent; cache growth is secondary.

Artifacts and all attempts remain under
`.uor-models/native-typed-value-2026-09-05/learned-routing-*`; angular is
`09f9991c`, exact-code selection `c6d3739d`, fixed placement `f7702f02`.
Four focused unit tests, allocation/source checks, artifact/session replay and
the actual CLI pass at their stated mechanical scopes. A parent-binding reload
bug was corrected without changing learned parameters; the failed attempt is
retained and charged. Model work is 46.768/120 seconds this cycle, cumulative
1,410.652/1,800 seconds, leaving 389.348. The post-evaluation storage sample is
5,852,442,624 bytes with 251,379,712 before the existing tighter stop. No storage
increase or deletion was needed. Refresh receipts before the next projection.

## Prior geo-transformer direction — owner clarification after #1145

**Next implementation: #1139's jointly learned geometric routing block.**
The [canonical plan](project-track.md#immediate-build-sequence) now connects
learned semantic placement, bounded source admission and selected integer/table
transformations to raw-text language and composition. More NoWrite caching or
residual score-bound optimization is secondary. #1140 remains the subsequent
multi-operation qualification; short composition tasks supply a learning/check
signal during #1139. This supersedes the then-next scheduling below, not any
measurement. At that checkpoint the block was **NOT_IMPLEMENTED / NOT_RUN**;
the implementation and measured limits are recorded above.

PR #1145 merged through protected delivery at `219f572fd8e9fda1e6ca3254dddbc1f2715d92f0`.
Sparse artifact `067adbf0` remains the selected bounded execution improvement;
the geometric partition has no established advantage over its matched sparse
index. #1137/#1138 retain their accepted bounded binding/memory results.

Source inspection confirms reusable UOR/addr identity, NAF/GNAF typed vocabulary,
R4G1 packing/borrowed execution and dormant XOR/popcount route selection. The
pinned `uor-matmul` float path contracts Atlas-coded operands through lookup and
exact accumulation; existing Rust training/reference code calls it. Neither
its implementation nor that existing use proves a new workload speedup or
removes the mathematical dense product. The plan names eligible offline and
bounded selected-operator uses without importing a dense transformer.

The inspected native generation path has no dense attention/projection or
provider call. Startup validation still reconstructs geometry with floating
point; complete integer/table serving realization remains unfinished. This
clarification runs no model, changes no dependency and adds no capability claim.
The cumulative model ledger remains 1,363.884/1,800 seconds (436.116 remaining).
Refresh current storage and project the entire next build/fit/evaluation before
execution; existing storage authorization and preservation rules continue.

## Exact NoWrite admission — 2026-09-05, prior checkpoint

**Retain the sparse admission artifact `067adbf0` as an execution improvement.**
It compiles 64 exactly guarded NoWrite decisions from the unchanged learned /2
writer. All 112 prior relation answers/write sequences and 28 new longer-context
answers/writes pass; both useful admission arms preserve 62+24 earlier responses,
eight binding outputs and five restored/isolated session reads. The actual CLI
matches. No writer refit or expansion of exact relation state is involved.

The geometric shortlist and sparse index use the same exact entries. Both
reduce the representative writer's comparisons from 2,054,052 to 91,884. Repeated
whole-generation timing and startup costs are in the
[admission record](../native_geometric_relation_admission_1139.md). The geometric
arm does not establish a speed advantage over sparse; collapsing its partition
forces correct full fallback. This is useful exact reuse, not a learned geometric
abstraction or general capability gain. All older artifacts/results remain.

#1138 merged in protected PR #1144 at `39e35c54`. **#1139 remains immediate and
its full handoff unmet; #1140 stays dependent.** Next test a conservative bound
on remaining writer scores from learned role/H4/zeta features, with a matched
sparse bound and exact fallback. Do not enlarge the signature cache or optimize
the tiny reader simply to generate more routing evidence. Refresh
`relation-admission-checkpoint.json`, the shared cumulative model ledger and
storage before a complete next-cycle projection. Necessary storage increases
remain preauthorized; this cycle deletes nothing and uses no paid compute.
Model work is 96.113/120 seconds for this cycle, cumulative 1,363.884/1,800
seconds, leaving 436.116 seconds. The last storage sample is 5,782,073,344 bytes
against the unchanged 6,459,228,160-byte cap; the existing tighter growth ceiling
leaves 321,748,992 bytes before its stop. Refresh rather than reusing that sample.


## Exact relation writer transfer — 2026-09-05, prior checkpoint

**#1138's bounded behavioral handoff now passes.** Selected artifact
`793cb9adad8bc812a85a46cf867495faae80b16570dc01b3244bf7887846caad`, at
`.uor-models/native-typed-value-2026-09-05/relation-role-model.json`, uses version-2
participant-masked role features and ordered interior H4/zeta transport.
The same 112 construction documents yield 84/84 OPEN answers and exact write
sequences, then 28/28 newly reserved answers and writes versus 24/28 answers and
14/28 writes for unchanged relation parent `16f4c10f`. The reader, exact store,
update laws and copy/completion path remain unchanged.

Preservation passes all 62 earlier responses, 24 prior role-reader responses and
eight binding outputs. Five actual restored/isolated session reads pass. All 84
version-1 Generation objects and relation states reproduce exactly on the new
executable. The [role-path record](../native_geometric_relation_role_path_1138.md)
binds source selection, tests, costs and limitations. Known grammar/name worlds
are the scope; no general memory, alpha or standalone geometric advantage claim.

The preceding storage PR #1143 merged at `50caf04de078b2eb5f225936bbc08c1d8291e4c0`.
After protected delivery of this correction, #1139 is immediate: geometric
metadata admission/routing at preserved write/answer quality and complete measured
cost, beginning with the dominant repeated NoWrite scoring. #1140 follows its
accepted handoff. Refresh `relation-role-checkpoint.json` and shared model/storage
ledgers before the next complete build/evaluation projection. Cumulative model
work is 1,267.771/1,800 seconds, leaving 532.229; this cycle used 38.821 seconds
model and 412.722 seconds engineering, with no cap increase or deletion. Older checkpoints
below retain their original verdicts and then-next proposals.

## Exact learned relation memory — 2026-09-05, prior checkpoint

**#1138 is implemented at development scope; its transfer handoff remains unmet.**
The optional `16f4c10f6b79807868c7774872ba58776acd68a08c0c22054f49aca5206ecbeb`
artifact learns association writes, revisions and persistent reads over sixteen
exact versions. It answers 56/56 OPEN cases with 56/56 exact write sequences after
raw-window eviction. The reserved check reaches 26/28 answers versus 12/28 parent,
but only 21/28 exact write sequences. Missing initial writes also corrupt later
contradiction handling. Keep #1138 immediate and #1139/#1140 blocked.

All 62 earlier responses, 24 prior role-reader responses and eight binding outputs
remain correct. Five actual session reads/revisions pass with isolated state and
restored source/version identity. Restore preserves every checkpoint field except
the separately reported historical stale-index work counter. A real NoRead
restore-validation bug is fixed. The first two fits and failed checks remain.
See the [relation record](../native_geometric_relation_memory_1138.md) for exact
artifacts, source splits, measured work and limitations. No general relation
model, alpha or geometric efficiency advantage is claimed.

#1137 was delivered in PR #1142 at `223aed71e770b158cebb0f0dd9a3d6be4f191829`;
`61a24cfa` remains the accepted predecessor. The next change is a participant-
independent local role representation for the relation writer, preserving exact
values, the store and the reader. Repeated name expansion is not the proposed
repair. Refresh `relation-memory-checkpoint.json`, the shared model ledger and
storage before its complete build/evaluation projection. The inherited storage
cap is unchanged at 6,459,228,160 bytes with 128 MiB margin; this cycle deletes
nothing and uses no paid compute. Cumulative model work is 1,228.950/1,800 seconds,
leaving 571.050; this cycle used 90.108 seconds model and 1,090.152 seconds
engineering. Older sections retain their dated scope.

## Role-aware source/entry handoff — 2026-09-05, prior checkpoint

**#1137 passes its bounded handoff.** The selected artifact is
`blake3:61a24cfa4ce262fd974bc8e84f082a0489db3b58cfafb46c4c42a86e49c13184`,
at `.uor-models/native-typed-value-2026-09-05/role-read-local-model.json`.
A learned joint occurrence/NoRead and entry choice now shares one exact source
through observed commitment and copying. Local role/context weights replace
pooled initial source votes; the sixteen-word capture, numeric behavior, /4
memory and completion remain. No semantic role codebook is claimed.

The artifact preserves 62/62 responses and 8/8 binding outputs, repairs the
previous sixteen-case wording set to 16/16, and improves the separate OPEN
transfer set from 16/32 to 30/32. The predeclared first-use set passes 24/24
versus 13/24 for the unchanged `5f590f1c` parent. Four new generated Rust
functions pass 28 executed assertions; 32 older sources remain byte-identical
to their checked versions. Actual native CLI Generation fields agree exactly.

The first role fit preserved only 61/62; removing pooled query identity restored
preservation and reduced rows from 4,804 to 3,973. Both fits remain preserved.
The [role-read record](../native_geometric_role_read_1137.md) states source,
first-use, geometric-control and complete-cost limits. Two older transfer cases
still abstain incorrectly. This is bounded binding/generation, not alpha or a
matched geometric superiority result.

The next build is #1138 after protected delivery of this #1137 handoff: learned
exact associations and updates surviving raw-window eviction. The plan PR #1141
merged at `0731aa0b6ac444c89b294e146e1dbe1f5742c40b`. Live GitHub owns delivery
and dependency status. Local cumulative model work is 1,138.842/1,800 seconds,
leaving 661.158; necessary storage cap is 6,459,228,160 bytes with the 128 MiB
margin. Refresh the local `role-read-checkpoint.json` and shared monitors before
projecting #1138. Historical checkpoints below retain their original scope.

## Immediate plan adopted from the research review — 2026-09-05

The owner has adopted the [four-step immediate build sequence](project-track.md#immediate-build-sequence):
[#1137](https://github.com/UOR-Foundation/uor-r4/issues/1137) role-aware shared
source selection/commit -> [#1138](https://github.com/UOR-Foundation/uor-r4/issues/1138)
exact learned relation memory -> [#1139](https://github.com/UOR-Foundation/uor-r4/issues/1139)
selective geometric access at complete cost -> [#1140](https://github.com/UOR-Foundation/uor-r4/issues/1140)
typed operator composition for conversation and Rust reasoning.

**At plan adoption, the earliest unmet step was #1137.** This plan adoption implements no new model and
qualifies none of those handoffs. Reuse current retained words, /4 memory,
copying and completion; learn relative role features and preserve one selected
occurrence through entry/commit. Current positional/pooled binding is the
observed representation limitation; it is not yet proven to be the sole cause
of the remaining wording failures. Do not start with larger context or another
special-purpose response head. See the [research synthesis](../native_geometric_direction_review_973.md).

Live verification: PR #1136 merged at `597a86a30b87558c4783590e02e8a45933188dee`.
The correction's results and limitations remain below. `d095a1ab` remains the
prior selected baseline; `5f590f1c` is the useful development correction.
The model ledger remains 1,081.641/1,800 seconds; this documentation/issue work
adds no model execution. Refresh cumulative storage and timing before the next
complete build/fit/evaluation projection. Necessary storage increases remain
preauthorized. Later sections are dated checkpoints; their then-next proposals
do not override the adopted sequence.

**Owner-directed recovery — 2026-09-04.** The canonical goal and development
plan is [project-track.md](project-track.md); the stable execution policy is
[agent-execution-policy.json](agent-execution-policy.json). Current model work
remains owned by [#973](https://github.com/UOR-Foundation/uor-r4/issues/973).
Refresh live GitHub before choosing a follow-up; dated snapshots and lower
historical “next” paragraphs do not select work.

## Zero-match entry correction — 2026-09-05, latest checkpoint

**Retain a useful development correction; the broader grounding milestone remains
unmet.** PR #1135 merged as `647fd532`. Its rejected shared-binding artifact
`f933b199` supplies the unchanged parameters for a single-row intervention:
zero the default/token scores of prefix feature32/value0, preserving that row,
its candidate postings, every other parameter and the integer/table serving path.
No fitting, new state, larger context or new geometric feature is introduced.

The corrected artifact is `5f590f1c9798c311ddd28b7d47ab1d444331fe08bdf92839a04b2c0fa0af1919`,
at `.uor-models/native-typed-value-2026-09-05/source-entry-neutral-model.json`.
The matched wording diagnostic improves 12/16 → 16/16; the now-open transfer set
improves 8/32 → 16/32, including supported answers 0/24 → 8/24 while preserving
8/8 unsupported answers. It gets all 62 preservation responses and 8/8 binding
outputs correct, restoring four fact regressions and both older city answers.
An actual native CLI run changes ` Unknown.\nKyoto.\n` to ` Kyoto.\n`.

After selecting this exact correction, sixteen first-use prompts yield 13/16,
against 11/16 for its unmodified shared-binding parent and 3/16 for the previously
selected `d095a1ab` artifact. The three failures all ask “Which city is … in?”;
all four unsupported answers remain correct. `Pune` occurred in prior material.
A vocabulary-novelty assertion failed before a shell continued into evaluation;
the later provenance receipt records this explicitly. Source preparation and
model selection preceded evaluation, with no subsequent tuning, but this is
not a fully sealed or vocabulary-disjoint qualification. The 16/16 milestone
has not passed; `d095a1ab` remains the prior selected baseline.

All 62 outputs and causal states agree with committed-copy dispatch disabled.
Complete generation totals 47.210/63.598 ms in one pass; this retains the existing
dispatch optimization and establishes no new geometric efficiency advantage.
The 32 generated Rust sources match previously executed sources by hash.
Local `source-entry-checkpoint.json` contains full work counts, artifact/source
identities, preservation, first-use provenance and cumulative resource accounting.
One focused fitted-artifact test, release example build, policy and formatting
checks pass. No broader release checks or refit ran.

The next implementation is #1137: a learned role-aware occurrence/NoRead choice
shared with response entry and preserved through an observed commit. This correction shows
that repeated unbound scores caused some failures, not that zero lexical matches
are universally irrelevant. Do not broaden zeroing or force copying from a match.

## Wording transfer and shared binding — 2026-09-05, later checkpoint

**Decision: reject the shared-binding candidate for promotion.** Keep the
composed fact artifact `d095a1abccefd68678a9d7da61e4d8fd094d9f7ca71e10c5e0383518889ed586`
selected. Its delivery, PR #1134, merged as `19f25ddb`. Useful geometric-only
conversation/coding remains the goal; broader transfer is not established.

A sixteen-case matched check separates question wording, speaker formatting and
numeric distractors. Distractors do not change outcomes. The selected artifact
gets 4/16 exact. Adding 96 construction cases to the existing 288, with unchanged
operators and fitting dose, reaches 12/16 but regresses four original abstentions.

The optional `shared_binding` implementation adds each retained occurrence's
existing query/source equality mask and preceding-word prime address to lexical
entry. It keeps the sixteen-word capture, /4 memory, typed operators, copy cursor,
completion frame and integer/table serving. Entry has at most 32 features; no new
persistent state or answer buffer is added. These features preserve local
matches and their multiplicity, while pooled scoring loses occurrence rank and
full clause/query meaning. All matching, dictionary lookup and scoring work is
included in the existing counters.

The shared-binding fit preserves 32/32 original,12/12 identifier and 8/8 binding
responses, but gets 12/16 prior fact cases and 0/2 old cities. It also reaches 12/16
on the matched diagnostic. A matched fit without copy-extension geometry has
the same preservation counts. The 32 reserved cases were authored before fitting
and opened once per frozen artifact after design selection, with no subsequent
tuning: selected parent 3/32, extra-coverage fit 0/32, shared binding 8/32 and matched
geometry-disabled fit 8/32. Both shared fits get only the eight unsupported cases
right: **0/24supported complete answers**. This is a transfer negative, with no
geometric advantage established. Existing benchmark/report OPEN labels do not
replace the first-use provenance in the local checkpoint.

The new fit's 62 responses and causal final states match with committed-copy
dispatch enabled/disabled. Complete generation totals 50.597/65.275 ms in one pass;
ordinary score lookups 1,619,990/1,867,776, memory 294,190/418,735, and copy 90,651
in both. Shared entry adds work; this is not an efficiency improvement over the
selected artifact. Failed outputs also contribute to those timings.

Local evidence lives under
`.uor-models/native-typed-value-2026-09-05/wording-checkpoint.json`, with frozen
sources, three fitted artifacts, all outputs/cost vectors, CLI equality and 32
unchanged generated-Rust compiler receipts. Checks passed 109 native units; after
repairing a serialized-row validation omission, 12 affected copy tests, the new
allocation fixture and the source word-bound test passed. Model work used
33.622/120 seconds; cumulative 1,058.856/1,800 seconds. Engineering used 1,104.632/1,200 seconds, including final
formatting, claim wording and all six preparation tests. Necessary storage increased 256 MiB
to a cumulative 5,653,921,792-byte cap, preserving the 128 MiB margin. No deletions
or external compute.

A concrete remaining hypothesis is that nonmatching occurrences should not cast
lexical votes: feature32/value0 currently penalizes the prefix space by 242 per
occurrence and Unknown by 196. This can favor abstention for unseen dictionary
words. Neutralizing that contribution and testing source-supported entry is
**not implemented or evaluated**. Do not widen context or promote these fits on
the strength of construction accuracy.

## Composed fact answers and committed-copy dispatch — 2026-09-05

The optional `composed_entry` extension now learns lexical output → retained-word
selection → exact byte copying → completion. It also learns NoCopy lexical
continuation after an actually selected first transition. No numeric fact is
required. It reuses the existing sixteen-word capture, immutable occurrence,
relative H4/zeta paths and completed-word frame. Exact query/source equality
features support unseen names. Older artifacts retain their previous behavior.

Artifact `blake3:d095a1abccefd68678a9d7da61e4d8fd094d9f7ca71e10c5e0383518889ed586`
is at `.uor-models/native-typed-value-2026-09-05/fact-copy-fit-3/model.json`.
It answers **16/16** fixed fact cases (four each simple, distractor, update and
unsupported), against **0/16** for the preceding artifact, while preserving
**32/32** original responses, **12/12** identifier transfers and **8/8** binding
outputs. All 32 generated Rust source hashes match prior compiler/execution
receipts. Three actual CLI runs match evaluator Generation fields exactly;
248 debug/optimized Generation objects match exactly. The two older city prompts
still fail: this is bounded grounding, not general conversation or alpha.

The cases were frozen before fitting, then exposed during an implementation-invalid
attempt. That attempt incorrectly marked 48 construction copy targets unreachable
because a label comparison omitted the prefix offset. Correcting that single
slice admits all 96 copy targets; no source, features or hyperparameters were
retuned. The sixteen cases now provide repaired OPEN development evidence,
not a fresh final-held-out claim. Both failed attempts and their material remain.

Committed interior bytes dispatch before ordinary candidate scoring, with score
`1` explicitly marking dispatch rather than a comparable ranking score. Required
observation/memory updates continue. All 62 outputs and final states match the
same artifact with dispatch disabled; focused tests also compare per-step
checkpoint state. On that workload, 114 forced bytes eliminate 255,348 ordinary
and 130,670 memory score lookups. Complete generation, including session setup,
encoding, ingest and decode, measured **46.864 ms vs 61.984 ms** in one pass.
All other instrumented work is retained in the local cost report. This is a
generic conditional-execution gain. Copy-geometry suppression reaches 3/16 fact
answers; a matched-refit geometric advantage remains undetermined.

The [existing evidence record](../evidence/native_geometric_word_copy_973.json)
and local `fact-copy-optimized/checkpoint.json` bind source, artifacts, costs,
negative history and preservation. Model work is **1,025.234/1,800 seconds**
(**78.172/120** this cycle); engineering builds/tests at that checkpoint are
**1,099.542/1,200 seconds**. Necessary storage increases total **+896 MiB** this
cycle, including the stopped task's extra worktree and a separate fitter cache;
the cumulative cap is **5,385,486,336 bytes**, retaining the 128 MiB stop margin.
Peak sampled model RSS is 767,180,800 bytes. No material was deleted.

The next bottleneck is wording transfer for the same retained facts. Test that
existing lexical/copy choice across question wrappers before adding another
mechanism. The approved cycle stops after protected delivery of this result.

## Retained words with observed completion state — 2026-09-05

The current optional response-entry `/2` model selects an exact retained word
occurrence, commits its immutable origin only after observation and copies its
bytes through a bounded cursor. The selected artifact enables
`completed_word_suffix`: a temporary suffix frame starts at the actual final
copied-byte observation, retaining H4/zeta state and the query prime while
excluding copied spelling and length from suffix features. The stronger `/4`
reader, typed `/2`, numeric completion and lexical-entry parent remain fixed.

| Same OPEN development | Original responses | Identifier transfers | City transfers |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| First copy fit, original suffix frame | 32/32 | 2/12 | 0/2 |
| Completed-word Full | 32/32 | 12/12 | 0/2 |
| Copy disabled | 32/32 | 0/12 | 0/2 |
| Copy geometry disabled | 28/32 | 0/12 | 0/2 |

Full preserves 24 numeric targets and eight binding outputs. All twelve new
functions compile and pass seven-input identity callers (84 assertions).
The twenty original generated Rust source hashes match their previously passed
compiler/execution receipts. All twelve initial copy decisions, the 57-word
dictionary and 512 selector rows match the first fit exactly. The changed suffix
law reduces 185 rows/260 associations to 42/48. Geometry-disabled still copies
the twelve correct declarations and fails afterward; all three suffix candidate
IDs remain in the artifact. This is combined feature dependence within one
fitted artifact on reused OPEN data, not a separately fitted geometric advantage.

The [record](../native_geometric_word_copy_973.md) and
[compact evidence](../evidence/native_geometric_word_copy_973.json) bind both fits,
replays, actual CLI execution, compiler results, costs and preservation. Selected
artifact: `.uor-models/native-typed-value-2026-09-05/word-copy-completed-fit-1/model.json`,
CID `blake3:46ad994bfdbcd376770c0e5e6f8150e68f0821eb1c7f05320b8121be8931d229`.
The final binary replays 104 original-entry and 146 first-copy Generation objects
exactly. Old artifacts and the first copy negative remain intact.

Ordinary scoring still executes for every copied byte. On the same original 32
responses, byte-emitting the four familiar `value` words adds sixteen prediction
steps: ordinary score lookups rise 918,979→949,464 and memory-score lookups
144,747→161,315, plus the new bounded copy work. The smaller suffix table and
better transfer are measured; a whole-model compute or latency advantage is not.

The next implementation is a learned lexical-prefix-to-copy transition. Both
city cases evaluate sixteen words but select inherited ` Unknown`; their exact
leading-space targets also cannot be composed by first-position-only copying.
The new transition needs positive construction and actual observed prefix state,
then can reuse this cursor and completion frame. It remains unimplemented.
General conversation, semantic multiscale abstraction, final held-out evaluation
and alpha remain unqualified.

The owner now authorizes necessary incremental storage increases. This cycle
records +104 MiB beyond the inherited 4,336,910,336-byte cap (which already
included the prior +40 MiB): the cap is 4,445,962,240 bytes with the same 128 MiB
stop margin. At 16:37:45 UTC, conservative accounted storage is 4,285,845,504
bytes, leaving 20,103,168 bytes below the checked-cycle ceiling. Model work is
947.062/1,800 seconds, leaving 852.938 seconds. Engineering builds/tests used
1,545.328/1,800 seconds for this cycle; the complete second-repair checks used
542.041 seconds against a 550-second projection. A successor needs a fresh
complete build/evaluation projection; these resource figures do not admit one
automatically. No material was deleted and no external compute was used.

## Preceding response entry with preserved typed completion — 2026-09-05

The current artifact adds `uor-r4.native-response-entry/1` to the unchanged
stronger occurrence reader `/4`, typed `/2` and numeric-completion `/1` model.
It learns canonical lexical entry after the typed selector chooses NoWrite,
commits only after matching observation, and corrects subsequent tokens from
bounded actual history and relative H4/zeta state. Numeric selection retains
precedence; no artificial numeric write or response template is inserted.

| Same 32 OPEN development cases | Correct numeric targets | Exact prose | Exact Rust |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Full | 24/24 | 16/16 | 16/16 |
| Entry disabled | 24/24 | 12/16 | 12/16 |
| Entry geometry disabled | 24/24 | 12/16 | 12/16 |

The eight previously incorrect NoWrite forms now complete. All eight binding
outputs remain exact. All twenty saved Rust records compile and pass execution
checks: sixteen numeric assertion programs and four identity functions tested
through separate seven-input callers, with eighteen distinct complete sources.
The first entry stays correct when geometry features are disabled, but subsequent
corrections disappear despite equal thirteen-token support. Ordinary decoding
supplies parts of every successful nonnumeric response and all its EOS choices.
This is combined score dependence within one fitted artifact, not a matched
refit, learned stopping or general geometric superiority.

The separate four-case transfer check is **0/4**: Oslo/Lima facts still receive
Unknown, and changing the Rust parameter to `input`/`count` still yields `value`;
both unchanged new Rust files fail compilation. Content-dependent response
selection is the observed remaining limitation. The head's thirteen-token support
cannot spell these outputs; ordinary model candidate absence was not measured.
The next content intervention should connect bounded retained occurrence/span
selection to response entry and observation, using actual query/source relation
features, rather than expanding fixed response-form priors.

The final runtime also reuses captured NoWrite while entry is active, avoiding
repeat failed operand searches under a verified frozen-input invariant. The
[response-entry record](../native_geometric_response_entry_973.md) and
[compact evidence](../evidence/native_geometric_response_entry_973.json) bind the
behavior, controls, costs, persistence, source and compiler receipts. Artifact:
`.uor-models/native-typed-value-2026-09-05/entry-fit-1/model.json`, CID
`blake3:316837f19043a4a69b481b44c234c06dc3a4c4a688069707eb1ea7137085a574`.

The same-artifact runtime optimization preserves all 104 compared generations
apart from decreased typed work. Across eight successful NoWrite responses,
proposals fall 256→32 and checked additions 128→16 (87.5% reductions); across
all 32 Full cases, additions fall 320→208. Ordinary scoring remains. This is
counted work, not a measured whole-model latency advantage.

The owner's approved storage cap is now 4,336,910,336 bytes (+40 MiB), with the
same 128 MiB stop margin. Cumulative model work is 925.824/1,800 seconds;
874.176 seconds remain. The 14:33:17 UTC accounting snapshot is 4,174,245,888
bytes, leaving 28,262,400 bytes under the checked-cycle ceiling. The largest
recent release-build growth was 30,887,936 bytes, before subsequent retained
outputs. Another checked implementation cycle is not admitted. All material,
including new generated compiler products and both historical negatives, is
preserved; metadata and protected delivery continue within their reserve.

Earlier checkpoints and their then-current next actions follow. Preserve their
evidence; use this pointer and live GitHub for active work. Final held-out
qualification and both alpha capability groups remain unqualified.

## Preceding typed values with geometric completion — 2026-09-05

The current development artifact adds optional `uor-r4.native-value-completion/1`
to the stronger occurrence-memory `/4` reader and typed-value `/2` component.
After an actually observed final numeral byte, it retains the derived write and
post-numeral H4/zeta anchor, compares current relative geometry and short ordered
context, and learns bounded byte/EOS selection. Its sparse scores, observation
law, integer/table serving path and session schema `/4` are implemented in Rust.
The baseline reader, tokenizer, geometry and typed weights remain unchanged.

| Reused open development (32 cases) | Correct numeric targets | Exact prose | Exact Rust |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Full | 24/24 | 12/16 | 12/16 |
| Completion disabled | 24/24 | 2/16 | 0/16 |
| Completion geometry disabled | 24/24 | 0/16 | 0/16 |
| Typed values disabled | 0/24 | 0/16 | 0/16 |

All four name-binding pairs now complete correctly on both sides (8/8 outputs).
Sixteen of twenty saved Rust records compile, execute and pass their assertions:
twelve primary numeric cases and four binding cases, with fourteen distinct
successful source hashes. The eight NoWrite primary cases remain unchanged and
incorrect. Neither arbitrary Rust execution by the model nor general conversation
or reasoning follows from this result.

All geometric-control candidates are the same six byte/EOS tokens; capacity is
sixteen with no drops. Suppressing only completion H4/orientation/phase features
preserves the first suffix byte but loses progression/termination. This supports
combined geometric-score dependence in this fitted artifact at equal support.
Individual-term effects, a same-budget geometry-free refit, independent response
forms and efficiency advantage remain unmeasured. Ordinary decoder work and typed
proposal execution still precede this head; no expert-compute saving is claimed.

The [completion record](../native_geometric_value_completion_973.md) and
[compact evidence](../evidence/native_geometric_value_completion_973.json) bind
source, binaries, all outputs, costs and preservation. The local artifact is
`.uor-models/native-typed-value-2026-09-05/completion-fit-1/model.json`, CID
`blake3:a1fa0314924fb324f994e449cce6e69793d6c4df6102353a959363cb766009ff`.
Prior typed `/1` and `/2` reproduce all eighty Full primary/binding Generation
objects under the current binary; both prior `/5` negatives remain preserved.

The next decision is a matched geometry-free fit and independent response-form
transfer for this small completion head, followed by cause-directed development
of the remaining nonnumeric cases. It is **checkpointed for storage**: cumulative
model work is 903.526/1800 seconds (896.474 seconds remain), but the 08:22 UTC
snapshot leaves 24,055,808 bytes of growth before the 128 MiB stop margin within
the 4 GiB allocation. The last release build alone added a measured peak of
29,683,712 bytes. Another checked implementation cycle is not admitted; preserve
all artifacts and user material, with no silent budget increase. Metadata and
protected delivery continue within the existing reserve. Final held-out
qualification and both alpha capability groups remain unqualified.

The following sections preserve earlier checkpoints and their then-current
next actions. They do not override the active pointer above.

## Preceding typed value creation — 2026-09-05 development

The native model now has an optional typed-value component on the stronger
`/4` artifact. It lexes signed integer values, learns bounded operand/action
selection, executes Copy or checked integer-domain `ZPhi::checked_add`, commits
the result with causal provenance, and emits decimal byte tokens through the
ordinary shortlist. It reuses the `/5` prediction/observation pattern while
preserving both fitted `/5` negatives. Typed records survive token-ring eviction
until their own sixteen-record store evicts them; this is deterministic retention.

The first `/1` fit selects correctly on 128/128 raw training examples. On 32
open-development cases it produces correct numerals on 12/12 prose and 8/12
Rust numeric targets, versus 0/12 in each family with typed values disabled.
Complete exact responses remain 2/16 prose and 0/16 Rust. All sixteen generated
Rust sources and four Rust binding-control sources fail compilation unchanged.
All four paired name swaps fail to select both correct results. H4/zeta-disabled
arms make the same primary typed choices as Full, so this establishes no added
typed-selection benefit from those features.

The observed representation loss is specific: the six fit names are lexical
tokens, while new development names split into bytes. Four-token source cues
retain fragments and the eight-token query loses relevant words. The `/2`
correction adds bounded exact whole-word cues across token splits and 64 varied
raw construction bindings. It selects 192/192 fitting cases and all 24 numeric
development targets; all four unchanged-query name-swap pairs now select both
correct results. Whole-word scoring disabled falls to 4/24, while H4/zeta-disabled
retain Full's typed actions and operands on all 32 cases. Complete responses
remain 2/16 prose and 0/16 Rust, and all 20 generated Rust sources still fail
compilation. Only the four previously failing Rust Add outputs change; the other
28 primary outputs retain their exact bytes and tokens.

The remaining numeric failures begin after completed numeral emission: every
Rust case fails at its first suffix byte or EOS. The scalar fitter trains no
suffix, and emitted byte-token history differs from canonical lexical encoding.
The next concrete integration is learned response progress and continuation/stop
selection at that value-to-completion boundary, using actual emitted histories.
Keep the improved bounded operand/write mechanism and both prior `/5` negatives;
do not substitute fixed response templates. The
[typed-value record](../native_geometric_typed_value_973.md) binds outputs,
controls, source/binary identities, preservation and focused checks. No general
binding, geometric advantage or alpha claim follows. Final held-out qualification
remains NOT_RUN. Cumulative model work is 894.645/1800 seconds; 905.355 seconds
remain, with storage the tighter constraint.

## Persistent response state — 2026-09-05

The native `/5` development option captures a bounded response query and its
initial posting references, commits model-selected occurrence identity only
after matching observation, and offers one retained source successor. Rust
fitting, generation, CLI/HTTP continuation and session checkpoints use this
same state law. It adds no arithmetic value construction or learned write
admission. The optional advancing-endpoint layout retains the captured query
while transporting its H4/phase relation through response progress.

Two matched fits on the same corrected source, readout, 512-token context and
6,548 response/EOS targets **do not improve the preceding `/4` artifact**:

| Full-path development result | `/4` | `/5` captured endpoint | `/5` advancing endpoint |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Prose first correct | 20/32 | 20/32 | 20/32 |
| Prose exact response | 6/32 | 5/32 | 5/32 |
| Prose completion prediction | 195/320 | 187/320 | 181/320 |
| Rust exact response | 0/32 | 0/32 | 0/32 |
| Rust completion prediction | 328/504 | 291/504 | 280/504 |

The first `/5` generated zero continuation actions; the advancing version
generated one. Response-state-disabled scores 0/32 and 1/32 exact prose in
the respective artifacts, establishing sensitivity without an improvement
over `/4`. Geometric controls remain mixed. Both new fits are retained
development negatives, and `/4` remains the stronger matched artifact.

The initial `/5` lost 61 formerly correct completion predictions; 60 targets
remained shortlisted. Repeated punctuation selected the same source occurrence
with the same score. Advancing the endpoint changed that scorer state without
widening support but did not recover quality. This rejects the two fitted
packages as quality upgrades; it does not establish a general geometric
failure. Two inspected first-fit Rust programs compile and execute, but both
fail assertions (86 versus emitted 92, and 23 versus emitted 120).

The [response-state record](../native_geometric_response_state_973.md) binds
the two artifacts, controls, actual output, focused checks, preservation and
cumulative resource accounting. Useful response composition remains open.
The separate absent-value cause requires typed operands, learned binding and
an exact result write inside the same native memory path; neither copying nor
response persistence performs that computation. Fixed checked `Z[phi]`
addition is reusable arithmetic, while operand selection and result use must
be learned and measured. Both alpha capability groups remain unqualified.

The following sections preserve preceding source/artifact checkpoints and
their then-current next actions.

## Local-path occurrence selection — 2026-09-05

The explicit native memory `/4` successor compares local source/query H4 and
fixed-zeta paths, then combines unique learned features reaching the same
retained occurrence. The token prior and shared bias contribute once per
occurrence. Training and integer/table inference use that same composition;
`--compose-occurrences` selects it in the resumable Rust fitter. It changes
selection, without computing new values or learning memory writes.

On one corrected, matched synthetic source, full `/4` improves prose first
selection from 15/32 to 20/32, exact responses from 5/32 to 6/32 and completion
prediction from 189/320 to 195/320 against newly fitted `/3`. Rust completion
prediction improves from 321/504 to 328/504, while first, exact and deterministic
function-prefix generation remain zero. Shared memory-disabled scores 4/32
exact prose and 0/32 Rust. Two sampled `/4` Rust outputs compile but contain
wrong assertions; they are not executed or counted as semantic passes.

The `/4` package changes local paths and evidence aggregation together, so its
gain does not isolate either component. Full `/4` has two more exact prose
responses than H4/geometry-disabled, but one fewer correct first prediction;
the controls disable baseline and reader terms together. Zeta-disabled improves
exact prose to 7/32. These are scoped development outcomes, not general
geometric advantage, a zeta benefit or alpha qualification.

Source `/2` repairs historical `/1` function tasks whose full completion used
test inputs missing from the prompt. All current test inputs are explicit;
old source bytes and results remain preserved, without cross-source numerical
comparisons. Both current fits use all 6,548 response-plus-EOS targets and the
same 512-token context, bounded admission and readout baseline.

The [occurrence-selection record](../native_geometric_occurrence_selection_973.md)
contains exact identities, generated behavior, controls, costs and preservation
evidence. The [mechanism map](../native_geometric_mechanism_map_973.md) traces
source through artifacts, session state and response generation. The measured
next distinction remains available-but-misselected repair/fact values versus
computed numeric values absent from retained copy routes. Persistent query
selection, learned writes, intermediate geometric values and useful joint
conversation/coding remain unfinished. The cumulative model ledger is now
784.729/1,800 seconds after final saved-artifact replay; the remaining
1,015.271 seconds are preserved.

The following sections preserve the preceding source/artifact checkpoints.

## Resumable fitting and broader joint composition

The native `/3` reader now has an explicit bounded, resumable Rust fitter.
Distinct supervised exposure is independent of the live example buffer;
calibration and epoch selection replay a consistent source-bound population.
Checkpoints restore learned weights, feature registration, calibration sums and
stage/cursors. Optional tokenizer-bound supervision intervals select response
losses while preserving whole-document context. The inference kernel, primary
prime/zeta/R4 state and existing reader schemas remain intact.

On one learned readout baseline with context 512, the whole-population fit sees
all 30,038 joint prose/Rust targets using 256 live examples. A real partial fit
and resumed invocation complete. Relative to the matched 4,096-position legacy
fit, prose teacher-forced completion prediction improves from 179/320 to 188/320
and Rust from 302/504 to 314/504. Raw exact generation reaches 6/32 prose and
0/32 Rust; the shared memory-disabled model reaches 7/32 and 0/32. A second fit
selecting all 6,548 response-plus-EOS targets reaches 196/320 prose and 306/504
Rust completion pieces, with exact generation 7/32 and 0/32. It improves neither
both families nor exact prose over memory-disabled and is not promoted as a
joint quality improvement. Each new stream artifact's eight sampled generated
Rust sources fail compilation and two actual-feedback repair attempts are
empty; none executes.

The reused broad-corpus comparison expands exposure from 4,096 to 32,768
positions and improves current eight-epoch accuracy from 32.8879% to 35.3499%,
still below memory-disabled 36.2485%. The expanded fit hits its 262,144-feature
cap with dropped events. Geometry-disabled scores 36.5151%; this establishes no
added geometric benefit in that comparison and does not demote the primary
architecture. These are open-development populations, including deliberately
new composition forms, not final held-out or alpha qualification.

The working historical artifact remains 96/96 in each finite family under a
fresh saved-model preservation check; its prior compile/execution evidence is
preserved. The [resumable fitting record](../native_geometric_resumable_memory_973.md)
contains exact artifact/source identities, generated outputs, checks and the
cumulative resource ledger. No historical results are superseded by a broader
claim. The current next implementation is targeted learned read/selection and
geometric value composition: distinguish admitted but misranked factual/repair
targets from arithmetic outputs absent from retained copy routes. Learned
writes, retention beyond ring eviction, richer geometric state/operators and
both alpha capability groups remain unfinished; further cue-table expansion is
not the measured next correction.

## Joint query-context checkpoint

The explicit native memory schema `/3` now learns both controlled prose recall
and Rust variable/update tasks on one artifact. It adds exact ordered-query-prime
and occurrence features, shares initial learning credit among admitted correct
routes, and calibrates the existing query-context bias before maximum-route
refinement. It changes no memory admission rule or runtime buffer width.

The 32-epoch word-cue artifact
`blake3:b5ba144fb293358bd45b77ce848f7ad100e26524cfd08586b2a96deea85c081d`
scores **96/96 prose and 96/96 Rust**, with both answers correct in all
48 paired value changes per family. Memory-disabled scores remain 43/96 and
39/96. All 96 unchanged generated Rust continuations compile; a separate
bounded link-and-run assessment passes their 96 assertions. These are finite
open-development tasks derived from 12 worlds, not independent final held-out
tasks or broad coding/conversation qualification. H4-, zeta- and
geometry-disabled controls also score 96/96 in each family, so this result
establishes no added H4/zeta contribution on the probe. Their primary
architectural roles remain intact.

The [query-context record](../native_geometric_query_context_973.md) preserves
the diagnosis, intermediate failures, final artifact and broader evaluation.
The [workflow](../native_geometric_workflow.md) describes the explicit
`--query-context --word-cues` fit and saved-model evaluation. Exact-cue `/1`
remains the default; the new path is selected explicitly. Final-code refitting
of `/1` and `/2` reproduces their prior model identities byte-for-byte.

The larger-corpus successor still regresses: 30.5684% next-piece accuracy versus
36.2485% with memory disabled on 146,668 targets. It learns 206,127 features
with zero drops, using 262,144 feature capacity. Thus the finite-task success
does not qualify this reader as a general replacement, and a feature-capacity
shortfall does not explain this particular regression.

The then-next work was to extend this useful joint reader into broader contextual
composition and generated-code behavior, using varied open development data,
adequate context/exposure and actual outputs. Preserve the finite-task artifact
as a working component; do not repeat this solved recall fixture as a new alpha
gate. Learned write admission, retained information beyond ring eviction,
nonlinear geometric state/operators and both broader alpha capability groups
remain unfinished under #973.

## Initial native recovery checkpoint

`r4 geometric` now connects Rust data preparation, count fitting, separate
readout fitting, learned query-relative memory reading, resumable training checkpoints, versioned artifacts,
development evaluation, generation, persistent sessions and a loopback
workbench. The same core model is exposed by `uor_r4_api::native_geometric`.
Its full prime identities, fixed zeta channels, exact H4 order, signed
orientation, typed paired coordinates and exact aggregate radial state are
actual computational inputs. The precise implemented roles and limits are in
the [recovery record](../native_geometric_recovery_973.md); run commands are in
the [native workflow](../native_geometric_workflow.md).

The first matched 32/128/512-token runs complete with no dropped events.
Learned-readout development accuracy is 26.9259%, 28.6717% and 24.7833%.
Geometry-disabled arms score slightly higher; all three global geometric gates
fit to zero. These are open-development next-piece predictions, not evidence
of geometric advantage or useful conversation. The preceding fixed formula's
negative results remain preserved.

The initial supplied-fact experiment separates capacity from useful reading:
larger windows retain 42/96, 72/96 and 96/96 answer-value tokens, but the learned
readout scores 24/96 at all three windows and changes none of 48 paired answers
when the supplied value changes. The implemented successor learns a
query-dependent read from the addressable memory ring. After correcting its
training objective, the exact-cue 512-token model answers 86/96 controlled prose
queries versus 24/96 with memory reading disabled, with both answers correct in
41/48 paired value changes. Geometry-disabled scores 66/96; zeta-disabled scores
91/96. These are scoped finite-grammar results, not broad geometric advantage.

Exact token cues remain the default. The optional word-cue equivalence map
preserves output bytes and geometry but regresses the separate prose model and
does not improve the separate Rust models. Its joint artifact improves prose
while regressing Rust. It therefore remains explicit `--word-cues` research;
the aggregate score cannot select it for both capability goals. Both artifact
schemas and every predecessor result remain preserved.

The final executable reproduces the useful prose artifact and the joint
word-cue artifact with identical identities and results. Increasing the joint
fit to 32 epochs per memory stage gives 82/96 prose and 30/96 Rust with exact
cues, versus the memory-disabled baseline of 43/96 and 39/96. Word cues give
82/96 and 32/96. The greater training dose still does not improve both groups.

Browser generation and exact session restoration run through the real artifact.
The initial Rust continuation fails a real compiler check. Both conversation/
memory and coding/reasoning alpha requirements therefore remain unmet. Do not
replace them with count-table accuracy or a working interface.

The larger open-data construction run increases training exposure from 75,448
to 391,725 target positions, with zero dropped events, 10.825 seconds elapsed
and 1,630,748,672 peak process bytes. Old 120-token/128-update/840-second settings
and one-retry rules are historical experiments, not limits on this path.
Continue within the owner's authorized objective and remaining cumulative
machine budget, preserving each versioned model and its actual results.

On that larger corpus, adding the optional learned memory reader reduces
development next-piece accuracy from 36.2485% to 33.2663%. Increasing its feature
capacity learns 77,773 features with zero dropped events, but accuracy falls
to 32.7638%; disabling memory restores the same 36.2485% baseline. This separates
the capacity problem from the unresolved generalization problem. Preserve these
artifacts as development evidence; do not promote the regressing reader.

The then-next model work was **useful joint learning on one native artifact**: retain
the exact-cue reader as a measured baseline, improve Rust variable/update and
actual code-generation behavior without sacrificing supplied-fact performance,
and develop learned write/selection/composition where the current automatic
ring admission and finite score tables are insufficient. Use balanced open
development examples, meaningful data/context exposure and actual generated
code feedback. An implementation or useful controlled copy result does not
close #973 or qualify either broader alpha group.
The query-context checkpoint above is the subsequent result; this paragraph
preserves the recovery checkpoint's direction rather than selecting a new task.

## Evidence carried into recovery

At the starting `main` revision `e3084eac47b04b540ccccf54d0547e37fa885882`,
[PR #1124](https://github.com/UOR-Foundation/uor-r4/pull/1124) had delivered a
Python sparse quaternion-cube fit command. Both admitted launches completed
backward and eight updates but exceeded their completion projection; no fitted
artifact or language-quality result was produced. Its terminal remains
`RESOURCE_UNAVAILABLE_FULL_CONTEXT_CUBE_FIT`. It does not show that the model
cannot learn. The then-next Python optimization is superseded by this native
recovery, while its implementation and all run evidence remain preserved.

Earlier Rust prime-route/table components, bounded #953 geometric intervention,
R4 transport/preservation results, exact paired representations and the native
four-fact bridge remain reusable at their measured scope. Neither those results
nor the current recovery plan establish useful general conversation, coding,
reasoning, geometric advantage or alpha. #954 remains a downstream correctness
home; later capability issues do not supply evidence by being open or closed.

## Historical handoff archive

Everything below records the pre-recovery checkpoints and their then-current
next actions. Preserve the results; use the active pointer above for new work.

# Historical programme map and correctness handoff (before native recovery)

**Active track: 2026-09-04.** The project is in
`build_first_architectural_alpha` mode. The exact ordered sequence and
checkpoint definitions are in [project-track.md](project-track.md). Live
[#973](https://github.com/UOR-Foundation/uor-r4/issues/973) owns the current
model work.

The old artifact-only pre-alpha condition is complete. The accepted #1119
comparator preserves full chronological K/V through exact H4 transport, and
`R4FixedRecurrentCausalKVBindingV1` provides the fixed 2,304-value / 9,216-byte
f32 K/V ledger.

`R4SparseGeometricCandidateSoftmaxKVBindingV1` is an executed mechanical
checkpoint. It ranks only the fixed twelve-slot metadata directory by exact
signed-S3 shell and full-H4-root maximin diversity, admits at most eight
persistent records, appends current, and gathers K/V only after admission. The
two frozen no-fit prompts reached at most nine attention sources with zero
complete-prefix scans or omitted-payload reads. They shared 12 and 3 generated
tokens respectively with the fixed recurrent comparator; this uneven result is
mechanism evidence, not useful-retrieval or language-quality evidence.

`R4H4FrameQuaternionCubeResidualV1` is the next executed mechanical
checkpoint. It splits the post-attention normalized residual into twelve R4
blocks, applies `q^3 / ||q||^2` in the current H4 frame with an exact zero
branch, decodes, and adds the resulting displacement. It uses the same sparse
reader and learned artifact, but bypasses every dense SwiGLU call. Both no-fit
prompts completed with bounded f32 errors and unchanged recurrent/causal
contracts; both diverged from the fitted dense comparator at their first
generated token and produced visibly degraded text. This establishes the
mechanism only. The current stage is a bounded development-data fit of the
assembled sparse-plus-nonlinear architecture before any larger scale increase.

The first bounded full-context fit task ended at
[`RESOURCE_UNAVAILABLE_FULL_CONTEXT_CUBE_FIT`](../r4_quaternion_cube_fit_973.md).
The exact 120-token graph passed its backward gate and reached eight optimizer
updates twice, reproducing update-one loss `10.436132` and gradient norm
`6.284435` to the reported six decimals. After the resource correction,
elapsed time to update one fell from `78.177` to `25.757` seconds, but the
corrected completion projection still
did not admit continuation toward 128 updates inside the 840-second wall. No
fitted artifact or language result was produced, and no validation or held-out
data was read. The
current implementation step is a lean differentiable training forward that
removes unused attention-weight materialization and precomputes the fixed
metadata-only sparse selections while preserving the current recurrent
computation graph.

Broad proofs, evidence ledgers,
publication, programme-wide research mapping, and release QA do not sit between
the build stages. SpiralCore, HELM, W33, NEMESIS, UOR, and H4/zeta sources are
consulted only for a concrete design seam, with original-source inspection and
direct UOR measurement before any capability transfer.

## Parked workbench source candidate

[#1105](https://github.com/UOR-Foundation/uor-r4/issues/1105) delivered the
[native four-fact workbench ADR](../adr/0006-native-four-fact-workbench-service.md)
and [machine contract](../r4_service_contract_1105.json). They specify one
dedicated, opt-in `r4-workbench` Rust host, one private same-executable worker
and the first four-fact research-reference shell. They are independently
accepted definitions. [#1107](../r4_workbench_candidate_1107.md) adds the
dedicated crate and candidate source for that host, private worker, private
comparison entry and shell. Source review freezes the result as
`WORKBENCH_CANDIDATE_SOURCE_FROZEN_UNBUILT`.

Compilation, tests, model loads, qualification calls, forwards, service/HTTP
execution, browser acceptance, numerical behavior and platform behavior were
`NOT_RUN_BY_POLICY` when #1107 closed. That remains the historical result;
the new policy does not retroactively qualify it. #1084 remains open and
unassigned, and its qualification is not the current project priority.

## Retained native result

[#1102 native reference](../r4_native_bridge_1102_execution.md) records
**`NATIVE_REFERENCE_PRESERVED`**. The one offline build passed; the separately
admitted comparison passed all twelve loader gates, 320/320 answers,
4,480/4,480 consumed roles and 16/16 refusals in both runtimes and phases.
All four full f32 tensors met the frozen absolute limit `1e-5`; the largest
error was `4.768372e-6`. Both fresh-process replays were exact. The comparison
used 1,280 forwards, zero fitting, 8.809784 seconds and 75,039,076 retained
ledger bytes; 26,910,720 bytes of full tensors remain available for review.

Independent result review accepts the bounded result; protected delivery is tracked in
[PR #1104](https://github.com/UOR-Foundation/uor-r4/pull/1104). Its earlier offline
cache failures remain recorded; exact locked cache restoration resolved that
preparation issue without changing dependencies or the frozen contract.
Both build and comparison envelopes are now consumed. Do not rerun either.

The measured binary provides research comparison modes, not a service endpoint;
its identity cannot be assigned to a newly linked host. Successful ordinary
`qualify()`/`answer()` operation and HTTP/lifecycle acceptance remain separate
integration decisions. #1083 typed integration and #1087 final lowering remain
separate. #973 stays open and #954 blocked.

The [#1086 contract](../r4_native_reference_1086_contract.json), delivered at
`93613bf82782ca78406fe2739dcc8d9e1d0f2b9e`, is unchanged. The observed scope is the
original 320 authoring rows and 16 refusals, B=1 both arms, known vocabulary and
query forms, four facts and the pinned reader/core/R4. It is empirical finite
preservation, with no mathematical proof, semantic novelty, general language,
longer context, generation, reasoning/coding or final integer-kernel claim.

### Retained empirical baseline

The [sole #1094 comparison](../r4_retained_comparison_1094.md) completed
**`CLAUSE_ADAPTER_PRESERVED`**, with exact full and oracle fresh-process replay;
independent review accepted the result. Its frozen population comprises 1,600 valid
rows (320 authoring and 1,280 withheld), 80 refusal rows and 16 boundary controls
across 20 already-observed groups. The same reader/core, known vocabulary/query
forms and four-fact context remain bound. All 1,600 valid inputs, complete compared
tensors and answers matched; all 96 refusal/boundary cases matched with zero model
forwards. These valid rows are related renderings, not independent semantic trials.
Execution plus replay used 6,400 logical forwards; operator wall time was
15.821630625 seconds and the final cumulative resource snapshot was 135.697821334
seconds including the conservative 120-second preparation debit.
The historical 3,465,401-byte ledger remains charged. Withheld permissions have
returned to mode 000; the consumed envelope cannot be rerun.

#1094's bounded scientific DoD is complete and the issue is closed through
[protected PR #1101](https://github.com/UOR-Foundation/uor-r4/pull/1101), merge
`eade29f4b78435e9857936786426bb34e596b301`. Its then-next native contract is now
specified under #1086 above. Native export, historical R4G1 interchange and final
integer/table serving remain separate boundaries; no native model work ran while
specifying that contract.

This positive branch removes externally supplied clause segmentation only within
the frozen controlled-language population. It establishes no new semantic worlds,
general English, generation, reasoning, coding, mathematical proof or final-kernel
qualification. #1079's weak-control verdict and #1082's descriptive limits remain
unchanged; #973 stays open and #954 remains blocked.

**Preserved earlier evidence and handoffs.** The preparation/release checkpoints
below describe their original outcomes and then-current next actions; the result
above supersedes their scheduling and `NOT_RUN` status for this sole comparison.

[#1079](https://github.com/UOR-Foundation/uor-r4/issues/1079), delivered by
[#1080](https://github.com/UOR-Foundation/uor-r4/pull/1080), is complete at
`LANGUAGE_R4_PRESERVED_CONTROL_WEAK`. All 156 primary criteria and all 25,600
answer comparisons pass. The fact-frame control meets the frozen strong-drop
criterion in six of six views; the valid token-frame control meets it in three
of six. Keep those results separate. These are six already-observed,
controlled-language views, not independent general-English or coding evidence.
The [measurement record](../r4_zoology_language_r4_1079.md) and its immutable
JSON envelopes remain authoritative.

The [#1082 diagnostic](../r4_token_exposure_1082.md) is complete at
`TOKEN_EXPOSURE_DESCRIPTIVE_COMPLETE`, with exact fresh-process replay of all
286,720 used-role measurements and complete evidence. The frozen reader,
core, frames, two renderings and control were unchanged. Averaged over the four
fact slots and 8,192 supported rows per view, view 0 gives fact locations about
0.0035% changed-frame attention; view 1 gives fact objects about 0.0039%. Other
used roles are near full exposure. Highly displaced roles retain
almost all their weighted individual displacement after pooling. Changed and
retained supported-answer strata have very similar role means. Role-selective
exposure and retained answers despite displacement are observed; no downstream
cause is established and #1079's weak-control verdict remains unchanged.

[#1085's specification](clause-segmentation-1085.md) is complete at
`CLAUSE_SEGMENTATION_SPECIFIED`. It defines one deterministic text-to-clause
adapter, exact raw-only input/output/refusal schemas and a separate empirical
comparison while preserving the reader/core, lexicon/query and four-fact context.
The [source audit](clause-segmentation-1085-sources.md) links original
NEMESIS/W33/UOR material without importing capability or proof claims.
#1085 itself performed no implementation, population preparation, fit or evaluation.

The [#1094 implementation/preparation](../r4_text_clause_adapter_1094.md) returned
`UNAVAILABLE_REFERENCE_REPLAY`. The committed adapter recovered all 320
authoring inputs exactly and matched all 16 refusal cases, but the OS denied
execution of the pinned interpreter before Python startup. In that stopped
preparation, model loads/forwards were zero; effective worker isolation, model
preservation, withheld comparison and replay were `NOT_RUN`. The independently
curated 1280 withheld valid, 64 refusal and 16 boundary-control rows remain sealed.
The original stop and its receipts are preserved. Supplied segmentation stays qualified.

The separate [#1096 readiness decision](../r4_isolated_runtime_readiness_1096.md)
recorded **`ISOLATED_RUNTIME_READY`** in its sole attempt: all four harmless
corpus/reference/history/results probes were denied, with null model states and
zero model loads/forwards/updates. The attempt took 2.058100333 seconds and had a
704,806,912-byte combined peak-RSS bound. Independent result review passed, and
#1096 was delivered at `6f21fc5f4c40b9620c9fec5e95a39097f812ae73`. This
qualifies the named runtime/probe contract; it neither proves the precise cause
of the original denial nor establishes model behavior or universal isolation.

The [frozen #1094 preparation contract](../r4_text_clause_preparation_1094.md)
now has an [implemented retained-evidence assembly and launch gate](../r4_retained_assembly_1094.md).
Committed source `07ec3f0d` produced the distinct metadata status
`PREPARATION_ASSEMBLED_FROM_RETAINED_EVIDENCE`, bound by assembly SHA256
`48fae2d391e347e89a290b12a8af97cf8266c5913a21e71f21c1bef74ef54c62`.
Independent exact-envelope release is
**`ACCEPTED_FOR_RETAINED_EVIDENCE_COMPARISON`**. The assembly's embedded
`NOT_ADMITTED` is immutable; the separate exact release receipt governs execution. This step
implemented admission/accounting/launch plumbing and assembled retained evidence
without a new preparation worker, model, fit, withheld read, comparison or replay.

The original preparation's final write/exit tail was unmeasured, so its full
120-second allocation remains quarantined as a conservative debit, not a
120-second observed runtime. The original 3,465,401 bytes remain counted; the
corpus is counted once and new receipts/spools add to that ledger. The next
separately activated task under **[#1094](https://github.com/UOR-Foundation/uor-r4/issues/1094)**
is its frozen comparison and fresh-process replay through `run-retained` from
the bound coordinator with the verified exact release. Fresh source,
runtime and release checks consume the 120-second execution allocation; replay
has its own 120-second allocation, with 120 + execution + replay at most 360
seconds. No new preparation or automatic retry is admitted. A durable admission
marker precedes fresh identity checks, and the execution-start receipt precedes
the first withheld hash/read; interrupted or stopped envelopes cannot be reused.
#1094 remains open, parked and unassigned after this delivery. Its original
`UNAVAILABLE_REFERENCE_REPLAY` is unchanged; comparison/replay remain `NOT_RUN`.
Neither assembly nor readiness revises #1079's weak token control, establishes
new mathematical proof or raw-text capability, or unblocks #954. #973 stays open.

The user-requested [afflom ecosystem review](afflom-ecosystem-followup.md)
inspects Prism, both Atlas sources, LexLean, lean4-prod, GNAF and both matmul
repositories. Typed arithmetic, identity and correspondence boundaries guide
#1083/#1087/#1089. No dependency repin, upstream execution or measured speed
improvement follows from the source audit.

## Sequencing and ownership

The active build sequence is fixed:

| Order | Stage | Current decision |
|---:|---|---|
| 1 | Fixed recurrent geometric memory | Executed mechanical checkpoint under #973; bounded state and summary use observed, quality unestablished |
| 2 | Sparse geometric attention | Executed mechanical checkpoint under #973; nine-source ceiling observed, useful retrieval unestablished |
| 3 | Nonlinear geometric block | Executed mechanical checkpoint under #973; finite-indexed R4 cube bypasses dense SwiGLU, useful language unestablished |
| 4 | Scale, data, and instruction behavior | Full-context fit reached backward and eight updates but missed its hard-wall projection; **next:** make the unchanged training forward lean enough to admit the fixed 128-update decision |
| 5 | Retrieval and tools | Typed retrieval/refusal plus real tool execution, feedback, and result ingestion |
| 6 | Representative product alpha | Grounding, composition, identity memory, coding, and tools in one local workbench |
| 7 | Rust/table lowering and optimization | Preserve accepted behavior in the bounded packed Rust runtime |
| 8 | Release proof, evidence, and QA | Reconcile and certify only the implementation intended to ship |

The older #973 → #954 → #955 → #962 → #963 → #964 → #965 dependency chain is
retained as issue history and capability ownership. It does not require a
proof, ledger, or evaluation campaign between active build stages. #1084 stays
parked until product-alpha integration; #954 remains blocked until the
architectural model exposes the consumer behavior it needs. #940 and #1090
remain release-stage governance/scorecard dependencies.

A research negative binds only its frozen tuple. Preserve it and do not repeat
it unchanged. A successor can re-enter with a material version change and a
reason the changed mechanism could alter the result. An `UNAVAILABLE` result
records an execution/source/environment boundary and does not rank the model.

## Historical #973 → #954 consumer contract

The detailed handoff below is retained for interface and evidence history. Its
freeze, replay, proof, ledger, and review procedures are not routine build-stage
requirements. Current work follows the sparse geometric-attention stage under
the build-first policy above.

This is the explicit intake specification for the current mechanism family.
It names the interfaces that must be qualified; it does **not** declare that
#1079 already satisfies #973's higher-context terminal or #954's final
source-free serving boundary. #954 remains blocked.

### Qualified reference available now

The present reference is the learned #1077 role reader plus the frozen #1073
compound-binding core, executed ordinarily and through the #1079 two-stage R4
adapter. Its reader consumes five clauses (four facts and one question), a known
vocabulary and controlled query forms. The independently accepted #1094 comparison
qualifies matching raw-text entry before that unchanged reader within its fixed
four-fact/known-query population. The reader performs soft role
pooling; the core attends over four facts plus the learned null and projects
through the full 4096-token vocabulary. The model receives no gold role or
answer labels at inference. It is not the older #953 decoded route loop and
does not inherit that loop's state schema or higher-context qualification.

The reference has a frozen reader artifact, core artifact, tokenizer/data
binding, model policy, native-frame bundle, implementation closure and result
envelopes, identified in [claim-ledger.json](claim-ledger.json). Its single-token
`UNKNOWN` task label is not yet a general typed abstention policy. Paragraph,
conversation and bounded-global state, contradiction handling, free generation,
and a production API for this artifact remain outside its measured scope.

### Required handoff schema

| Field | Required semantics | Current boundary |
|---|---|---|
| `artifact` | Versioned manifest with model/artifact bytes identity, implementation revision, lexical codec, model/input policy, geometry/frame identities, data lineage and qualified runtime plan. | #1079 binds these for its research execution; a native loader must preserve them. |
| `input` | Ordered lexical units, query, admissible evidence records with stable identities/provenance, and an explicit context snapshot. Declare segmentation, maximum support and supported shapes. | Five supplied clauses remain qualified; #1094 also qualifies matching raw-text entry on its fixed four-fact/known-query population. No hidden canonical fields, target labels, future text or oracle answers may enter the model. |
| `state` | Versioned prior-state identity; ordered hierarchy records and implemented scope; causal append/update rules; bounded-global snapshot identity and size. Unsupported scope is typed unavailable, not fabricated state. | The current fact-binding reference does not implement the required paragraph/conversation/global state handoff. |
| `output` | Tagged `ANSWER`, `ABSTAIN`, `CONFLICT`, `CLARIFY` or `UNSUPPORTED_SCOPE`; lexical output and selected IDs where applicable; no substitution of provider text. | The reference emits a task answer token. The remaining tags and their behavioral policies require qualification. |
| `evidence_trace` | Consumed record/snapshot IDs, causal positions/support, declared geometric contributions, selected output, state-before/state-after identities and complete work accounting. | A trace is provenance. Only matched interventions establish whether its qualified state affects the answer. |
| `replay` | Pinned artifact/input/runtime, exact decision and permitted numerical comparisons, immutable result, independent-process replay and resource report. | Reuse the existing evidence when bindings are unchanged; freeze any new comparison envelope before seeing outcomes. |

The serialized field names above define the handoff to implement; they are not
claims that an existing public API already emits that schema. Keep actual
manifest/file CIDs distinct from model-state CIDs and from derived trace keys.

### Admission and decision criteria

1. **Freeze and reproduce the accepted reference.** #973 must name the exact
   artifact and input/state/output schema. Preserve the current ordinary/R4
   result and its weak token-control finding. A successor may not obtain a pass
   by revising the revealed #1079 threshold or replacing its control.
2. **Qualify the required context before correctness intake.** On a declared
   independent population, the accepted paragraph/conversation/bounded-global
   state must change the actual decoded decision under matched disabled or
   permuted-state controls, with natural support/work and causal access bound.
   The owning child freezes populations, numeric criteria, runtime and divergent
   actions before evaluation. Generalization from a supplied four-fact task
   cannot be assumed, and no new numeric floor is invented by this map.
3. **Meet the consumer's execution boundary.** #954's final terminal requires
   its native source-free/forbidden-operation contract. Current dense/softmax
   research code is a reference, not evidence that this serving condition is
   met. A separately scoped reference probe must retain that distinction and
   cannot close #954's final terminal.
4. **Keep correctness labels out of mechanism selection.** The accepted
   artifact and state rules are frozen before #954's independent answer or
   constraint oracle is consulted. Do not tune admission, roles, geometry,
   support, conflict policy or candidate costs against the correctness reveal.
5. **Apply #954's existing four-case entry decision only after admission.** A
   global-only fact must fail when global state is disabled; a conversation/global
   conflict must be surfaced and handled by the frozen policy; a local supported
   fact must remain correct; an unsupported question must abstain. Report the
   denominator four, answered-conditional and overall correctness, and separate
   conflict/abstention outcomes. This entry probe does not establish broad
   correctness or frontier capability.

If provenance is unavailable or the accepted context is inert, #954 remains
blocked and the owning #973 mechanism is revised or retired according to its
frozen decision. If the admitted four-case correctness probe fails, stop and
revise C1 without expanding or tuning the revealed population. Only the actual
qualified C1 artifact proceeds to #955's reasoning contract; product fixtures
and imported project memories do not substitute for it.

## Keeping this map current

Update this pointer only when the actual next project action changes. Routine
build-stage pull requests do not update the claim ledger, knowledge index,
duplicate status mirrors, proof records, or evidence dossiers. Preserve dated
records in place. Use [CONTINUE.md](CONTINUE.md) for the next task and refresh
live GitHub rather than treating this snapshot as permanent eligibility.
