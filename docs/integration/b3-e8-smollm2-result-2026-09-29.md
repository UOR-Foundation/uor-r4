## 1. Executive Summary & Scientific Verdict

Under Lab 1 directive B3 (Track B's second lever), Anti-Gravity evaluated geometric lattice weight coding on SmolLM2-360M's MLP weights (`gate_proj`, `up_proj`, `down_proj`, totaling 235,929,600 weights across all 32 layers) at 2, 3, and 4 bits per weight against standard 4-bit round-to-nearest (RTN) and scalar controls under an exact Randomized Hadamard Transform (RHT).

### Pre-Registered Kill Criterion
- **Rule**: `Kill: 3-bit E8 is more than 0.05 nats worse than round-to-nearest 4-bit. Record it and stop.`
- **Measured**:
  - $\Delta \text{NLL}_{\text{RTN-4bit}} = +0.071494 \text{ nats}$ (at 4.2765 bpw)
  - $\Delta \text{NLL}_{\text{RHT-E8P-3bit}} = +4.962782 \text{ nats}$ (at 3.0134 bpw)
  - Excess degradation over RTN 4-bit: $\mathbf{+4.891289 \text{ nats}}$
- **Verdict**: **`KILL CRITERION TRIGGERED (+4.891289 > 0.0500 nats)`**.

Per [D12](DECISIONS.md#d12--negative-evidence-retention-and-promotion-gates) and [D9](DECISIONS.md#d9--prevent-experiment-loops-and-preserve-the-context-contract), this negative result is preserved at its exact technical scope. Offline uncompensated $E_8$ lattice vector quantization of dense MLP weights—as evaluated in this study using an uncompensated offline implementation with heuristic sign selection over the QuIP# E8P codebook and homogenized by a Randomized Hadamard Transform—suffers severe compounding error across deep layers. This negative result characterizes this specific offline uncompensated implementation on SmolLM2-360M MLP layers, without asserting broader claims about canonical QuIP# or disproving all $E_8$ lattice quantization as a family. No positive conversion claims are asserted. In accordance with directive B3, Anti-Gravity halts further offline sweeps on this arm and preserves the negative evidence.

## 4. Analysis of Findings

1. **Exact Codec Round-Trip Verification**:
   Every one of the 96 MLP weight matrices across all six quantization arms passed exact bit-for-bit serialization and deserialization checks before dequantization (`codec_roundtrip_gate_passed: true`), ensuring that serialization bugs are completely ruled out as a source of degradation. Note that serialization round-trip (`to_bytes` / `from_bytes`) verifies storage fidelity, but does not establish that the encoder found the optimal nearest codeword in Euclidean distance.
2. **Bits Per Weight Accounting**:
   Bitrates were derived strictly from stored file bytes:
   $$\text{bpw} = \frac{8 \times \text{serialized\_bytes}}{\text{quantized\_weights}}$$
   The E8P codecs achieve exact theoretical storage: 2.0134 bpw for 2-bit, 3.0134 bpw for 3-bit, and 4.0134 bpw for 4-bit (including row scales and metadata).
3. **The Root Cause of Lattice Vector Quantization Collapse**:
   - Why does a scalar grid beat the $E_8$ lattice by 4.23 nats at 3 bits?
     Scalar quantization at group size 32 assigns an independent scale factor every 32 weights ($2560/32 = 80$ scales per row). This allows fine-grained local scale adaptation across different feature channels.
   - In contrast, $E_8$ lattice vector quantization packages 8 dimensions into a single codeword normalized by a single row-level or coarse-block scale. Even though $E_8$ offers optimal 8D sphere packing density in $\mathbb{R}^8$, the uncompensated residual orientation error across 8 coupled dimensions propagates nonlinearly through the SwiGLU activation ($\text{Swish}(x W_{\text{gate}}) \odot (x W_{\text{up}})$) and across 32 transformer layers.
   - Without second-order Hessian feedback (such as GPTQ or QuIP#'s LDQ rounding) or Quantization-Aware Training (QAT), uncompensated post-training vector quantization struggles to preserve deep language model behavior.
4. **Implementation Scope & Encoder Suboptimality**:
   The experimental encoder (`quantize_e8p_block`) used a fast heuristic sign-candidate search (fixing sign patterns per parity coset based on `target[i] < 0`), which evaluates at most two distinct sign patterns (evaluating at most 512 candidate codewords out of 65,536). As demonstrated by the counterexample regression in `test_e8p_encoder_counterexample_and_oracle`, codeword 256 is encoded as codeword 128 with squared error 4.0 despite codeword 256 having zero error. A reference oracle search over all 65,536 codewords via exhaustive enumeration under declared f32 arithmetic is provided in `oracle_nearest_e8p_codeword`. Both the heuristic encoder suboptimality and the absence of second-order Hessian compensation or training adaptation are possible contributors, with their relative effects unisolated in this evaluation.
5. **Definitive Decision Scope**:
   This experiment preserves the measured negative result for uncompensated offline $E_8$ lattice vector quantization on SmolLM2-360M without QAT. Per directive B3, this specific offline arm is halted without parameter sweeps. No positive conversion claims are asserted.

## 5. Next Steps

With Item 2 completed and preserved as a definitive negative:
1. Deliver Item 2 via PR referencing #1513, #1509, #820.
2. Update `docs/integration/current-state.md` to reflect the B3 kill criterion verdict.
3. Advance immediately to **Item 3: Metal Kernel Port** to unlock training throughput for 30M models (`cpu-accelerate` baseline first, then 7 custom stack ops in `geometric_stack.rs`).
