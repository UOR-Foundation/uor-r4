# Baseline and Working Assumptions — R⁴ Graph Compiler

Phase 0 deliverable of `docs/r4_graph_compiler_implementation_plan.md` (§5 Phase 0).
Date: 2026-07-21. Status: living document; numbers are marked **fresh** (measured this phase),
**cited** (from prior certificates), or **pending** (harness in flight / tool missing).

## 1. Working assumptions for decisions D1–D8

Adopted as working assumptions on maintainer go-ahead (2026-07-21); reversible until the plan is
formally committed. Full text: plan §2.

- **D1** — Commit scope is the M0–M5 tranche. Go/no-go at the M.V.G. checkpoint (§4 below).
- **D2** — Reproducibility semantics: canonical deterministic compiler mode (normative scalar FP,
  pinned seeds, no platform BLAS) for certificate-bearing artifacts; platform-accelerated modes
  allowed for local iteration, validated by behavioral equivalence (PDF §15). Recorded in
  `docs/transformerless/R4G1.md` §7.
- **D3** — Evaluation distribution: declared in §2 below.
- **D4** — Runtime fallback: consult EXCT exact-residual evidence, then abstain with explicit
  status; manifest-declared per status. Chat UX decided when Phase 5 lands the manifest.
- **D5** — Phases 6/7 are trigger-gated on measured region counts / bytes-read counters, not
  scheduled.
- **D6** — Deployment target: **revised by maintainer 2026-07-21** — the primary deployment target
  is another platform (to be named before Phase 1 freezes R4G1 widths and runtime features); wasm
  is demoted to optional. Caller-owned-bytes-first remains as a target-neutral design rule.
- **D7** — Process: backlog filed as GitHub issues #11–#34 under Phase milestones on
  `UOR-Foundation/uor-r4`; work continues on `feature/proof-carrying-semantic-routing` with the
  graph path cfg-gated; benchmark/reproducibility gates run on the pinned dev machine until a
  pinned CI runner exists.
- **D8** — This plan serves the research thesis. Product-usefulness gate (chat quality eval)
  required before funding Phases 8–10.

## 2. Evaluation distribution declaration (D3)

**Decided 2026-07-22 (maintainer):**

- **Continuity partition**: the existing teacher-generated story corpus (`Corpus`,
  `compiler.rs:51`) with its 80/20 construction/held-out split (`train_cut`), so new numbers are
  comparable to the cited P2 certificate.
- **Natural partition**: a pinned **Simple English Wikipedia** sample, license **CC BY-SA 4.0**
  (recorded in PROV as SPDX `CC-BY-SA-4.0`). Sizing and split rules are fixed at first use
  (target: a few thousand articles, construction/held-out by content hash), pinned by CID; the
  corpus manifest lives under `.uor-models/` and its CID is referenced in artifact HEAD/PROV.
  (Alternative considered: TinyStories validation split — cleaner licensing-wise but keeps the
  evaluation synthetic; rejected in favor of a genuinely natural distribution.)
- All fidelity claims carry: distribution id, n, confidence interval, slices, seeds, stopping
  rule (Gate K). No claim generalizes beyond the declared distribution.

## 3. Baseline measurements

### 3.1 Fidelity

| Metric | Value | Status | Source |
|---|---|---|---|
| top-1 accuracy | 28.9% | cited | PROOF.md P2 (legacy stories15M teacher, ~10⁵ store keys) |
| teacher-argmax agreement | 31.7% | cited | PROOF.md P2 |
| bits/token (WB) | 6.54 (teacher floor 1.5960, ceiling 70.4%) | cited | PROOF.md P2 |
| store keys | 89,200 | cited | PROOF.md P2 |
| HF-path evaluation tooling | exists | landed | PR #41 (`evaluate-report`); issue #34 closed |
| **Gate C harness (Phase 4)** | TLA3 store baseline 31.7% / 11.88 bits-token | fresh, 2026-07-22 | `r4 transformerless score`, fixture corpus, 30,036 held-out positions — reproduces the P2 agreement anchor; bits/token is the canonical cross-entropy definition (GLOSSARY.md), scorer+ds named |
| **Gate C: graph formula v1 (Σ-over-cloud)** | **0.3% / 70.47 bits-token** | fresh, unfavorable | correlated sibling-subtree residual stacking (issue #64, redesign in flight) |
| **Gate C: Rule 1+2 (chain+precedence)** | **31.7% / 9.86 bits-token** | fresh, 2026-07-22 | argmax-identical to baseline on all 30,036 positions, better bits; redesign landed (#64 closed) |

**Canonical bits/token (issue #76, resolved 2026-07-22):** one definition — mean cross-entropy of
the true next token under a scorer's predicted distribution, `(1/N) Σ −log2 P_scorer(v_i|c_i)`
with floor mass included (GLOSSARY.md). Values are comparable only within the same scorer AND
distribution; the historical "families" are scorer/distribution differences, not metric
differences: 6.54 = P2 certificate (Witten-Bell store, legacy corpus), 11.88 = same helper on the
fixture corpus (Gate C baseline row), 9.86 = Rule 1+2 graph scorer on the fixture corpus.
Every report must name scorer + distribution alongside the value.

Important: the cited certificate belongs to the legacy llama2.c stories15M teacher, **not** to
the current default SmolLM2-135M-Instruct compile. The Gate C harness reproduces its 31.7%
agreement anchor on the fixture corpus; HF-path certificates for the SmolLM2 compile are
producible via the PR #41 tooling on the D3 distribution (§2).

Natural partition — 17,457 held-out positions:

| scorer | top-1 agree | bits/token |
|---|---|---|
| graph Σ-cloud (old) | 0.03% | 60.41 |
| graph chain (Rule 1) | 0.19% | 56.69 |
| graph chain+EXCT (1+2) | **15.04%** | **13.30** |
| TLA3 store baseline | 15.04% | 18.76 |

Status: ExactContext 17,457 / Graph 0 / Novel 0. Win/loss 1+2 vs baseline: 2,626 both, +0/−0,
14,831 neither — argmax-identical on every position. Candidate recall (Rule 1 / 1+2):
64.9%/85.0% and 44.5%/62.6% top-1/top-3. Witness replay 64/64. Graph: 41 nodes, 458 edges,
10.53 MB scored artifact.

Continuity partition — 40,342 held-out positions:

| scorer | top-1 agree | bits/token |
|---|---|---|
| graph Σ-cloud (old) | 0.005% | 50.32 |
| graph chain (Rule 1) | 3.23% | 46.97 |
| graph chain+EXCT (1+2) | **14.76%** | **14.62** |
| TLA3 store baseline | 14.76% | 20.63 |

Status: ExactContext 40,342 / Graph 0 / Novel 0. Win/loss 1+2 vs baseline: 5,955 both, +0/−0,
34,387 neither — argmax-identical. Candidate recall (Rule 1 / 1+2): 60.5%/79.1% and
42.7%/59.6%. Witness replay 64/64. Graph: 45 nodes, 532 edges, 21.56 MB scored artifact.

§4 rows 1–2 verdicts (baseline = each run's own HF-path TLA3 store row):

| row | natural | continuity |
|---|---|---|
| 1: agreement ≥ baseline + 5pp (stretch) / ≥ baseline (floor) | 15.04% vs 20.04% — **stretch FAIL; floor PASS** (equal) | 14.76% vs 19.76% — **stretch FAIL; floor PASS** (equal) |
| 2: bits/token ≤ baseline − 0.3 | 13.30 ≤ 18.46 — **PASS** | 14.62 ≤ 20.33 — **PASS** |

Deployed quality gate (`src/r4g1.rs::validate_quality_report`: Rule 1+2 agreement must not be
worse than baseline): **PASS on both partitions** (agreement equal, never worse).

Read of the gap vs the fixture row above (Rule 1+2 = 31.71%/9.86, TLA3 31.7%/11.88, n=30,036):
the fixture is the legacy stories15M-teacher distribution, so its 31.7% anchor is not comparable
to these first SmolLM2-teacher measurements beyond harness shape. Within the D3 distribution
(same teacher, same artifacts, same harness), natural text is mildly easier for the store than
the teacher's own generations (+0.28pp agreement; baseline bits 18.76 vs 20.63, −1.88), and the
pure graph lane (Rule 1, no EXCT) is far weaker on natural text (0.19% vs 3.23%): natural
8-token contexts repeat across articles far less than teacher-generated ones, so region-level
residuals transfer poorly while exact-context store coverage stays total (ExactContext 100% on
both partitions — the Rule 1+2 rows are entirely EXCT-driven, hence argmax-identical to the
baseline).

### 3.2 Artifact sizes (fresh, 2026-07-21, `.uor-models/compiled/smollm2-135m-instruct/`)

| File | Bytes | Note |
|---|---|---|
| `tless_artifacts.bin` (TLA4) | 1,710,348 | codebooks, thresholds, class sigs (incl. certifier-only f32 `ctx_cb`) |
| `tless_store.bin` (TLS1) | 494,286 | graded evidence store — **stale: u16-era entries (6 B); current u32 parser rejects it. Regenerate via recompile; incident validates R4G1's versioning rules** |
| `tokenizer.bin` | 528,975 | byte-level BPE export |
| total deployed | 2,733,609 | vs. ~271 MB BF16 source (~99× smaller, nominal) |

Cited for the legacy artifact: 87.2× compression at 0.9692 mean cosine (full depth), 28.1×
end-to-end vs. 60.8 MB source (PROOF.md P5).

### 3.3 Runtime contract

All fresh numbers verified 2026-07-21 by `tests/allocation_census.rs` against the real SmolLM2
artifacts (deterministic across runs; debug profile).

| Metric | Value | Status |
|---|---|---|
| multiplies in runtime kernel | 0 (machine-checked source scan, witness P-4) | cited/enforced |
| integer ops per token | ~1.8×10⁵ | cited (PROOF.md P1, legacy path) |
| op census, SmolLM2 path (32 greedy tokens) | **144,496 avg ops/token**: adds 48,530 · xors 36,864 · shifts 11,666 · compares 1,324 · table-reads 46,112 | fresh |
| allocations per generated token, steady state | **0** (asserted over 32 tokens across `assign_window`, `predict`, `predict_witness`, `generate_greedy_into`; `Runtime::new` also 0) | fresh, Gate B pattern holds |
| allocations, warm-up (finding) | **5 allocs / 496 B during the first ~34 predictions** — `Runtime.recent` (repetition guard) is a `Vec` that grows to steady-state capacity. The "allocation-free hot path" is amortized, not unconditional. Graph-runtime fixed-capacity `RuntimeState` (Phase 5) removes this by construction | fresh |
| allocations at parse/load | artifacts: 18 allocs / 1.71 MB; store (real, legacy TLS1-u16 parse): **57,498 allocs / 5.40 MB for a 494 KB container** (~10.9× — per-key `Vec<u8>` + `BTreeMap` nodes) | fresh; Phase 1 R4G1 packed layout is the fix |
| allocations on write path (`add_evidence` ×64) | 563 allocs / 51.1 KB | fresh, known; formalized as patch epochs in Phase 9 |
| bytes read / cache misses per token | deferred | needs pinned runner (D7) |
| per-token latency | pending | needs bench harness (criterion) |

### 3.4 Reproducibility

- κ-reproduction (byte-identical recompile) holds on macOS for the legacy path, fixtures in
  `crates/uor-r4-core/tests/fixtures/baseline_kappa.json` (`--release --test kappa_reproduction
  -- --ignored`). Cross-platform byte equality is **not** claimed today (platform SIMD FP in the
  compiler) — this is exactly what D2 addresses.
- **Baseline anchor moved 2026-07-21** (maintainer decision): the pin was stale from
  `b142c93`-era after two deliberate compiler redesigns — `5baa7c0` (phase-10: u32 token IDs, new
  corpus record layout with top-3 tokens/weights, oracle separation) and `bbdd596` (hash-index
  RVQ projection, relational prefixes). Investigation before re-pinning: (1) compiler determinism
  verified — two independent compiles produced identical 27-κ sets; (2) stage-0 drift traced to
  those redesigns, not to nondeterminism or platform wobble. The same u32 migration is what
  invalidated the on-disk TLS1 store (§3.2). Re-pinning helper: `dump_baseline_kappa` in
  `tests/kappa_reproduction.rs`. Lesson recorded for Gate E: an unversioned baseline plus a
  redesigned compiler = a broken reproduction gate; R4G1's HEAD records compiler identity for
  exactly this reason.

## 4. M.V.G. checkpoint targets (D1) — CONFIRMED

**Confirmed by the maintainer 2026-07-22 ("all defaults", unamended).** Absolute values are set
relative to the first HF-path certificate (PR #41 tooling); reference points are the cited
legacy numbers above. These are the go/no-go contract for the Phase-5 checkpoint review:
missing 1–2 or 4 ⇒ stop or redesign; missing 3/5/6 ⇒ redesign discussion.

Pass conditions for the Phase-5 minimum viable graph, all on the declared distribution (§2):

1. Teacher-argmax agreement ≥ (HF-path TLA3 baseline + 5 percentage points), and in no case
   worse than that baseline (Gate C floor).
2. Bits/token ≤ HF-path baseline − 0.3.
3. Deployed artifact bytes ≤ 2× the current TLA4+TLS1 total (~5.5 MB).
4. Zero allocations per token step (hard requirement, Gate B).
5. Per-token latency ≤ 2× the current runtime on the pinned machine.
6. Novel/Contradictory fallback rate measured and reported; on-distribution rate < 20%.

Missing target 1–2 or 4 ⇒ stop or redesign. Missing 3/5/6 ⇒ redesign discussion.

## 5. Threat-model note (backlog #22)

Full adversarial model: `docs/transformerless/THREAT_MODEL.md`. Headline threats: crafted region
activation, overlap poisoning, frontier/candidate exhaustion, fallback denial-of-service, integer
saturation, collision with privileged concepts. Defenses: strict fan-out/frontier limits,
validated routing bytecode, checked integer semantics, bounded patch layers, adversarial collision
suites, separation of semantic routes from cryptographic identity.
