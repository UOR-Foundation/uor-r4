# The research lines

A research line is one sustained question the project worked on, such as "how does the discrete model read earlier text". The audit sorted all 1,173 recorded pieces of work into 20 lines. This page lists them, shows when each ran, and says in a word where each stands. Seventeen lines have at least three records and get their own page. None has produced a model that holds a useful conversation: the project is pre-alpha and **1 of its 8 milestones is complete (M1)** ([PLAN](../../../PLAN.md), [STATE](../../../STATE.md)).

![A timeline from July to October 2026 of the 12 largest of the 20 research lines, with one dot per dated record; the 8 smaller lines are not shown](../../figures/research-lines-timeline.svg)

*When each line ran. The September lines end as the October discrete line begins; the tooling and operations lines run alongside.*

## How to read the table

- **Records** are catalog entries. They mix lab records, lane results, reviews and plans, so they show where effort went and not how many experiments ran. Source: `archive/catalog.jsonl`, counted with `jq` on the field `line`.
- **Results** are the records whose outcome is positive, negative, inconclusive or diagnostic-stop. The rest are plans, tooling, process, review, operations and blocked runs. A *blocked* record is a run that could not start; it is not a negative.
- **Span** is the first to last dated record in 2026. Some records carry no date and are left out of the span.
- A positive record reports that the target the record itself set was met, at the scope it states. Many are narrow, scored on a panel the authors wrote, and none is a language result.
- **State** follows the project's vocabulary. *Active* means on the current model path. *Parked* means the tested forms failed or broke a rule and the mechanism stays open (decision D22). *Closed* means the line stopped (a line label only: its mechanisms keep their board status); a negative closes a configuration and never a mechanism. *Preserved* is evidence kept inactive.

The three short lines are listed in the [generated archive catalog](../../../archive/CATALOG.md) with all their records. The `vsa-native-prose` records are in [`archive/labs/vsa-native-test-2026-10-09/README.md`](../../../archive/labs/vsa-native-test-2026-10-09/README.md), the E8 record is in [`archive/labs/e8-orbit-memory-2026-10-11/README.md`](../../../archive/labs/e8-orbit-memory-2026-10-11/README.md), and the `m6-reasoning-coding` record is [`archive/w33_geometry_qualification_845.md`](../../../archive/w33_geometry_qualification_845.md). The VSA and E8 orbit memory mechanisms have pages on [the mechanism board](../../mechanisms/README.md).

## What the whole table shows

- **Two lines hold 42% of the records.** `native-geometric-sept` (294) and `m1-discrete-attention` (199) together hold 493 of 1,173 (arithmetic from the table).
- **The "Results" column counts every recorded result, including ones scored on authored or exposed panels.** Read it with [what the project knows](../findings.md): development is not fresh, and a pass on a built panel is not a language result.
- **Tooling and operations records are large.** `harness-governance`, `compute-ops` and `spiralcore-wire` hold 207 records and no model result. Part of that came from owner decisions that forced a rebuild in October (`docs/labs/repo-renormalization-2026-10-19/audit/synthesis.md`, section 3).
- **`m1-discrete-attention` has now closed at M1 scope.** The saved model scores 7,002 and 7,001 of 14,287 on DEV, above T2's 6,300 and unigram's 1,226. K16's older 65 and 463 are history, not the current best.

## Since 27 Oct

**30 Oct 2026.** The table above stops at 19 Oct. The discrete path has since closed M1, while the float-trained FBS trunk carries current complete-reply research. See [the pipeline map](../../model/pipeline-map.md) for both paths and [the M1 research line](./m1-discrete-attention.md) for the close. The project is pre-alpha: 1 of 8 milestones is complete. Claude-220 serves the point key inside one float model on fresh p-w, improving templates by +41/+40/+42 at three seeds with exact claude-219 parity; the gain recalls TRAIN replies, not new wording. [Claude-222](../../loop/tasks/point-key-integer/claude-222/REPORT.md) has built the integer point table, search and `/8` record, with 380 library tests and a full serving audit. [Claude-224](../../loop/tasks/point-key-integer/claude-224/REPORT.md) has built the panel decode and grade; next is unit 3's real TRAIN export, p-x scoring and laptop measurement.
