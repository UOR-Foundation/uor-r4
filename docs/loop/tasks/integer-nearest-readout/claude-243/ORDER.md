# ORDER: integer-nearest-readout, claude-243

Lab: claude. Item: [integer-nearest-readout](../../../../roadmap/items/integer-nearest-readout.md). Base: `abbfb0001`.

## Goal

The item's done-when reads:

> 1. **The artifact carries its readout,** with a negative gate. An artifact without it decodes byte for byte as at the base, and an engine without it refuses a nearest artifact.
> 2. **The nearest step** serves `stack_whole_table_nearest`'s rule under the field, with a test against a reference scan and a negative gate.
>    - The browser path (`wasm_serve`'s step) gives the same token as the session's nearest on one artifact, with a test.
>    - The serving audit (`audit_zero_matmul_serving.py --stack`) and the WASM build pass.
> 3. **End-to-end token parity passes its bar, under a prep sheet with a fresh FIT and a pre-run review.**
>    - Integer greedy of (r-drop) step 16,384, memory on, against claude-220's stored float greedy on DEV and p-w at seeds 1–3.
>    - It is reported as first-token agreement and whole-reply agreement. The bar is registered in the sheet against the exporter's known rounding residual (claude-227: 0.33% of sequence positions).
>    - **The item is done only when the bar passes.** On a miss, the sheet's row is recorded, the item stays `ready`, and the next unit locates the gap.
>    - Integer decodes run on the laptop: product serving (CHARTER §3.6), under the owner's 31 Oct allowance for this chain. The float side is stored GPU output.
> 4. **Tokens per second,** with the nearest scan counted (4,096 rows a token), and the resident memory.
> 5. **One notebook row, and a REPORT with the negatives first.**
