# ORDER: integer-hamming-read, claude-187

Lab: claude. Item: [integer-hamming-read](../../../../roadmap/items/integer-hamming-read.md). Base: `98a2f3b52`.

## Goal

The item's done-when reads:

> 1. The integer runtime runs the whole read as claude-146's REPORT describes it, all four heads of both reads, under D11's rules (CHARTER §3.6: integer only, no float or transcendental instruction; since D80 and D81 the hardware integer multiply and divide are allowed once [`integer-mul-div-serving`](integer-mul-div-serving.md)'s audits allow them, and until then products go through D11's tables):
>    - **copy heads:** keys and queries from the table's points through the key rotation. These depend only on the token, so their codes can be built once per vocabulary entry;
>    - **type heads:** queries from the residual through the query rotation, and payloads from the residual at `s` through the value rotation. These rotate the state at run time, so each product goes through D11's tables;
>    - the codes packed into 64-bit words; the match by `popcount(q XOR k)`; the 16 nearest earlier positions `1 ≤ s < t`; the weights `max(0, m − d)/m`; the stream read after layer 2 and the move on the readout, each product through the tables.
> 2. **Parity,** against the float forward of the same stored checkpoint (claude-146's language runs, `caseyallard/uor-r4-store:results/claude/hamming-read-2026-10-27/`), on DEV. No D11 tolerance exists for this read yet, so the unit's prep sheet pre-registers the bar for two numbers, and the REPORT gives both:
>    - the share of (position, head, read) kept sets equal to float's. One sign flip in an integer rotation changes a code, so this is not assumed to be exact;
>    - top-1 agreement between the integer and float decoded ids.
>    
>    The float reference is computed on the GPU (CHARTER §3.5); the integer side runs on the laptop, as serving does.
> 3. **Speed on this laptop:** `fbs-toks` decode tokens/s against context, with the read and without, on the same artifact.
> 4. One notebook row; the result on main.
