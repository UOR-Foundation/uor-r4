# UOR-R4 Geometric Language Model — roadmap

## Capability direction

The [canonical project plan](docs/integration/project-track.md) owns the ordered roadmap and acceptance. Live [#820](https://github.com/UOR-Foundation/uor-r4/issues/820) is the programme tracker; [current-state](docs/integration/current-state.md) owns retained artifacts and changing results. This file is the short navigation view of that plan.

| Order | Responsibility / live issue | Why it belongs here |
|---|---|---|
| 01 | [#1139](https://github.com/UOR-Foundation/uor-r4/issues/1139) — Learn contextual phrase and role binding | The retained model admits correct values but can choose the wrong phrase start. This is the nearest observed cause; adding unrelated geometry or more shape-only fits cannot distinguish genuine feature aliases. |
| 02 | [#1140](https://github.com/UOR-Foundation/uor-r4/issues/1140) — Learn shared state transitions and compositional emission | Reliable binding must become reusable computation and language construction. A growing list of answer-family heads cannot establish a general model. |
| 03 | [#973](https://github.com/UOR-Foundation/uor-r4/issues/973) — Integrate the geometric model and learn general prose | Bounded copy attention and correct short answers do not establish a language model capable of sustained original prose. This issue owns both the integrated native architecture and the missing broad linguistic learner. |
| 04 | [#962](https://github.com/UOR-Foundation/uor-r4/issues/962) — Develop conversation and identity-scoped durable memory | Useful local assistance needs meaning to survive turns, corrections and restarts, with explicit user/project isolation. |
| 05 | [#954](https://github.com/UOR-Foundation/uor-r4/issues/954) — Qualify grounded correctness, conflict handling and abstention | Fluent output must distinguish supported claims from missing or contradictory evidence before it can support reliable reasoning. |
| 06 | [#955](https://github.com/UOR-Foundation/uor-r4/issues/955) — Qualify generalized multi-step reasoning | Executing a familiar arithmetic operator is not flexible reasoning. The model must compose accepted operations and preserve constraints on genuinely changed problems. |
| 07 | [#1088](https://github.com/UOR-Foundation/uor-r4/issues/1088) — Develop executable Rust coding and controlled workspace use | The coding goal requires working programs and repairs in real context, beyond familiar code-shaped responses. |
| 08 | [#963](https://github.com/UOR-Foundation/uor-r4/issues/963) — Scale quality with complete-path M1 latency, energy and memory | The project exists to reduce energy and wasted compute. Eliminating matrix products is an architectural constraint, not itself evidence of lower energy or useful speed. |
| 09 | [#964](https://github.com/UOR-Foundation/uor-r4/issues/964) — Establish scoped serving, geometry and artifact guarantees | Serving claims need contracts for the operations actually executed, while mathematical proof must remain separate from language capability. |
| 10 | [#1172](https://github.com/UOR-Foundation/uor-r4/issues/1172) — Complete the native capability API and WASM model runtime | One coherent model must expose its actual abilities to applications before Studio integration can be meaningful. |
| 11 | [#1173](https://github.com/UOR-Foundation/uor-r4/issues/1173) — Run the native geometric model in GitHub Pages AI Studio | The final user-facing goal is the already developed Studio running our own local geometric model in the browser. |
| 12 | [#965](https://github.com/UOR-Foundation/uor-r4/issues/965) — Qualify, release and iteratively improve the local model | Alpha requires integrated conversation/memory and coding/reasoning on the delivered model; frontier capability is a longer-term evidence-driven objective. |

All responsibilities are unfinished at this reconciliation. #1139 is the immediate priority. The numbered order guides implementation and qualification; it does not prevent necessary correctness, integration, cost or interface work when its inputs exist. Each issue explains what, why, source/evidence, implementation, acceptance, dependencies and resources.

Native bounded inference and contextual/copy attention exist; general prose and reasoning, broad coding, frontier quality and full-task energy advantage remain unqualified. See [the capability/direction assessment](docs/integration/model-direction-2026-09.md). Shared contextual transitions/emission must carry us beyond copied-answer patterns; model scaling follows measured quality/cost needs. API/WASM integration precedes claiming that the Pages Studio runs this model.

The owner-requested issue reconciliation inspected all 422 pre-existing issue records, reviewed all 11 open scopes, preserved all 411 closed statuses, refreshed all 11 open issues and added #1172/#1173. No issue was closed as complete. [The full census and prior bodies](docs/integration/issue-reconciliation-2026-09.json) preserve the cleanup history. Metadata census is not a claim to have re-audited every closed experiment.

## Historical roadmap

The [complete previous roadmap](https://github.com/UOR-Foundation/uor-r4/blob/bc03f2d7ffde99608da370808eca542360e54508/ROADMAP.md) retains original release/cloud/hologram/transformerless tracks and the exact beliefs at that revision. [Research records](docs/RESEARCH.md), [the architecture audit](docs/integration/architecture-2026-09/README.md) and [project map](docs/PROJECT_MAP.md) locate their source and outcomes. Their old next steps do not override the current owner-directed plan.
