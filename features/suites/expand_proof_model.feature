Feature: Expand proof model for structural graph and planner guarantees
  The executable proof model must verify graph output determinism, canonical serialization, bounded memory and frontier resources, constraint preservation safety, planner horizon termination, evidence non-duplication traceability, replay witness integrity, and fixed-point Q8.8 arithmetic safety without panics.

  Scenario: Verify determinism obligation across independent graph executions
    Given a graph planner calculation closure
    When verified by the structural guarantee verifier for determinism
    Then the obligation status is Verified and determinism is verified

  Scenario: Verify canonical serialization ordering for graph nodes and edges
    Given a list of node IDs [10, 20, 30]
    When verified against canonical serialization obligations
    Then canonical ordering passes cleanly
    And unsorted node IDs [30, 20, 10] fail with a canonical ordering violation error

  Scenario: Verify resource bound obligations for memory and frontier size
    Given actual memory usage 512 bytes and limit 1024 bytes
    When verified against bounded resource obligations
    Then the resource bound obligation passes cleanly
    And actual memory usage 2048 bytes against limit 1024 bytes fails with a resource bound error

  Scenario: Verify constraint safety obligation for state trajectories
    Given a state trajectory ["s0", "s1", "s2"] and forbidden region ["hazard_0"]
    When verified against constraint safety obligations
    Then constraint preservation passes with zero forbidden states entered
    And entering "hazard_0" fails with a constraint safety violation error

  Scenario: Verify planner termination and horizon bounds
    Given a planner path length 5 and horizon limit 10
    When verified against planner termination obligations
    Then planner horizon termination passes cleanly
    And path length 15 against horizon limit 10 fails with a planner termination error

  Scenario: Verify evidence non-duplication and deletion traceability
    Given a list of evidence IDs ["ev_1", "ev_2", "ev_3"]
    When verified against evidence traceability obligations
    Then evidence traceability passes cleanly
    And duplicate evidence IDs ["ev_1", "ev_1", "ev_3"] fail with an evidence traceability error

  Scenario: Verify replay witness digest hash integrity
    Given actual witness hash "hash_abc123" and expected witness hash "hash_abc123"
    When verified against replay witness obligations
    Then replay witness integrity passes cleanly
    And actual witness hash "hash_abc123" against expected hash "hash_xyz999" fails with a witness mismatch error

  Scenario: Verify fixed-point Q8.8 arithmetic score bounds
    Given a raw score 2048
    When verified against fixed-point arithmetic obligations
    Then fixed arithmetic score safety passes cleanly
    And raw score 70000 fails with a fixed arithmetic overflow error

  Scenario: Audit proof matrix status against expected obligation entries
    Given the default proof matrix
    When theorem "Allocation Freedom" is audited against expected status Verified
    Then the audit succeeds and status matches
