Feature: Formalize compilation as semantic compression with rate-distortion tradeoffs
  The graph compiler must treat compilation C: Theta -> G as lossy semantic compression, evaluating rate terms and teacher distortion curves across progressive depth tiers.

  Scenario: Evaluate rate-distortion curves across progressive depth tiers
    Given a pinned mini-corpus "pinned_mini_corpus_01" and depth tiers [1, 2, 4, 8]
    When rate-distortion analysis is executed by the semantic compression analyzer
    Then a deterministic RateDistortionReport is produced containing 4 depth evaluation points
    And teacher KL divergence reduces monotonically as projection depth increases

  Scenario: Identify optimal rate-distortion tradeoff point
    Given a rate-distortion evaluation report for depth tiers [1, 2, 4, 8]
    When analyzed for optimal rate-distortion tradeoff
    Then depth tier 4 is identified as the optimal tradeoff depth
    And the report certification status is verified

  Scenario: Reject invalid projection depth tier
    Given an invalid depth tier array containing 0
    When rate-distortion analysis is executed by the semantic compression analyzer
    Then analysis fails with an invalid depth tier error
