Feature: Hologram/R4 Formal Monograph and Specification Completeness
  The formal monograph must consolidate all 19 formal analysis sections, reference valid implementation module paths, explicitly disavow non-goals, and pass programmatic audit verification.

  Scenario: Audit complete formal monograph for section and module link coverage
    Given the living formal monograph document
    When audited by the monograph traceability verifier
    Then all 19 monograph sections are verified present
    And 12 implementation module links are verified
    And 3 non-goal disavowals are verified present

  Scenario: Reject formal monograph missing a required section
    Given a monograph draft missing section "Section 1: Problem Statement and Non-Goals"
    When audited by the monograph traceability verifier
    Then validation fails with a missing section error

  Scenario: Reject formal monograph missing non-goal disavowal
    Given a monograph draft missing non-goal "No Human-Level Reasoning Claim"
    When audited by the monograph traceability verifier
    Then validation fails with a missing non-goal error
