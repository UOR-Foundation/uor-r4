Feature: Quantum Geometric Transformerless Wasm Façade & Context Scaling Benchmarks
  Scenario: Fold input text sequence into 256D quantum geometric state matrix via Wasm façade
    Given an arbitrary text input string
    When the Wasm façade folds the text using cd_space_fold
    Then a 256-element integer state matrix is returned
    And the state matrix has a non-zero parameter checksum

  Scenario: Benchmark context scaling across sequence lengths asserting constant memory footprint
    Given context sequence lengths of 1000, 10000, and 100000 tokens
    When the context scaling benchmark is evaluated
    Then the state matrix memory footprint remains constant at 512 bytes
    And the per-token update latency remains bounded under 50 microseconds
