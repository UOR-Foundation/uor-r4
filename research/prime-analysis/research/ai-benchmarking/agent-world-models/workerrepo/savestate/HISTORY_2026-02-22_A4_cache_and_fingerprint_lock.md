# HISTORY — 2026-02-22 — A4 Cache + Fingerprint Lock

Timestamp (UTC): 2026-02-23 01:25:45Z

This file records the work completed in the A4 session focused on **phase transport / mean-reversion** experiments and, critically, **locking the canonical pipeline** so stateless workers stop accidentally drifting.

## Why this history exists

We hit repeated “SUSPECT” moments where results were inconsistent across worker windows because:
- Workers are **stateless** (no shared memory), so “do it like last time” is meaningless.
- Several seemingly equivalent signal-processing choices (FFT masking conventions, Hilbert implementations) produce *different* `theta_mod` even when they look “the same”.

So we moved from “trust me bro” to **cryptographic fingerprints**:
- `SHA1(x_kept)`, `SHA1(u_bp)`, `SHA1(theta_mod)`, `SHA1(R)` must match the canonical reference.
- If any hash fails, the worker must stop and not emit downstream metrics (to avoid contaminating conclusions).

## Canonical pipeline (locked)

Parameters:
- L = 131072
- x_range = [100000.0, 9000000.0]
- train_frac = 0.7 (time-ordered)
- detrend_W = 2000 (causal, past-only moving average)
- bandpass cycles/sample = [0.002, 0.01]
- Delta = 0.01
- seed = 12345

Pipeline steps (exact):
1. Load `chebyshev_psi.npz`: `x_grid`, `psi_minus_x`.
2. Build `t_raw = log(x_grid)` and interpolate `psi_minus_x` onto a **uniform t grid** of length L over `[min(t_raw), max(t_raw)]`.
3. Compute `x = exp(t_uniform)` and restrict kept indices to `x in [x_min, x_max]` → `x_kept`.
4. Detrend: `u = u_raw - causal_moving_average(u_raw, W)` where the moving average is **past-only including current sample**.
5. Standardize `u` using **TRAIN-only** mean/std → `u_z`.
6. Bandpass `u_z` using **rFFT/irFFT with a nonnegative-frequency mask** (do NOT use full FFT with |f| masking).
7. Compute analytic signal using **`scipy.signal.hilbert(u_bp)`** and define `theta_mod = angle(analytic) mod 2π`.
8. Compute prime-window residual:
   - `P_i = # primes in [x_i, x_i*exp(Delta))` via `searchsorted`.
   - `E_i = x_i*(exp(Delta)-1)/log(x_i)`
   - `R_i = (P_i - E_i)/sqrt(E_i)`

This produces:
- dt = 0.00012297217348543395
- N_kept = 36592
- train_end = 25614

Fingerprints (must match):
- x_kept: `c455fedeff29bb2d0b2c81864970c09638720baf`
- u_bp: `b16b32cb5d4e63be1c61b88fcf4711d0656da14e`
- theta_mod: `8b33c57df436d37179b13b1899bf86a723f0e98a`
- R: `5753ee7d59c7d155c4a1b9b5fba8912d557598f2`

## What we learned this session (high-level)

1. **Rotation scan “wins” didn’t generalize**.
   - A4.06b showed large VAL AUC peaks at certain phase-bin shifts, but TEST gains mostly vanished, indicating overfit/geometry compensation.

2. **Two-curve sign(R) gating didn’t help**.
   - A4.07: letting positive/negative R use different phase-response curves did not add lift vs single-curve. In some settings it slightly hurt.

3. **Mean reversion is real; phase-modulation is subtle**.
   - A4.09: basic mean-reversion model (`dR` vs `R_i`) is strong; adding phase-interactions gave small lift at h=25 and essentially none at h=100.
   - Rotating phase features doesn’t change the linear subspace when using full sin/cos harmonics (invariance under constant rotation).

4. **Omega (phase velocity) was not the missing sauce**.
   - Adding omega or omega-interactions did not improve, and sometimes slightly hurt.

5. **Transport feature gave small lift at h=25, negative at h=100**.
   - Transport = Δθ_h / τ (with τ=2π) showed ~+0.001 AUC at h=25; negative deltas at h=100.

6. **τ and 125 are not privileged constants (so far)**.
   - Commensurability tests against shuffle/null did not show meaningful concentration for τ or 125.

7. **The big practical win:** we nailed down the exact implementation needed to reproduce `theta_mod`.
   - The failure mode was “almost the same Hilbert/bandpass”, producing a totally different `theta_mod` hash.

## New artifacts created

### Canonical cache NPZ
Path: `/mnt/data/A4_CANONICAL_CACHE_L131072_x1e5_9e6_W2000_bp002_001_D001_seed12345.npz`

Contains:
- `x_kept`, `u_bp`, `theta_mod`, `R`, `dt`, `train_end`, plus params+hash metadata.

Purpose:
- Future workers can load this and skip recomputing ψ interpolation, detrending, standardization, bandpass, Hilbert, and R construction.
- This prevents drift and reduces compute time.

---

## Leader role going forward

Leader (you):
- Decide the next minimal test based on prior results.
- Specify exactly what a worker must compute, including the canonical cache path and hash checks.
- Keep the narrative straight: what changed, what didn’t, what got falsified.

Worker (stateless compute):
- Do one job.
- Verify fingerprints before reporting any conclusions.
- Emit JSON only unless explicitly asked to write a cache/history file.

## Current project state

We have:
- A locked canonical phase pipeline (hashes match).
- Evidence for strong mean reversion in R at h=25 and h=100.
- Weak/unstable evidence for phase-dependent modulation in the mean-reversion slope.
- No support yet for τ or 125 as privileged commensurability constants for the instantaneous rotation rate.

Next likely direction:
- Replace per-bin beta(theta) (noisy) with a direct regression of dR on:
  - R_i
  - transport Δθ_h (or sin/cos of it)
  - interaction terms capturing whether transport modulates MR, evaluated with stricter regularization and permutation controls.
- Or return to the phase → conditional intensity (Cox/Poisson) track and test whether it can be expressed as a transport-driven correction.
