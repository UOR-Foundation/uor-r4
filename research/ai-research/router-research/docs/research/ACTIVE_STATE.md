# Active Research State

Purpose: this is the single canonical live-queue file.

Use this file to answer:
- what the active research gate is
- which increment is actually next
- what mathematical object is under test
- what counts as success or falsification

Do not treat `CURRENT_DIRECTION.md`, `HANDOFF_CURRENT.md`, or `LIVE_WORKLOG.md`
as authoritative when they disagree with this file.

## Canonical Queue
- Current primary RR: `RR-061`
- Current primary INC: `INC-0139` (pending creation — break shell-level indistinguishability between real and col-perm embeddings, or accept shell is norm-driven and pivot to angular law)
- Current primary increment doc:
  `docs/research/increments/INC_0139_TBD.md` (pending creation)
- Kill-list stage: `measure-consistent shell routing`
- Mathematical object under test:
  `first-factor routing manifold on H^4; shell law sensitivity to angular-norm joint geometry vs norm-only geometry`
- Success condition: `a shell law parameter change (K, delta_r, growth) makes shell metrics discriminate real from col-perm inputs (shell_pmax or shell_entropy differs by >0.1 between GEOM_ORIG and GEOM_COL_PERM) OR explicit decision to accept norm-driven shell and focus Stage 2 effort on angular law`
- Falsification condition: `if no shell law parameter separates real from col-perm, document norm-driven shell as a fundamental constraint and pivot Stage 2 to angular improvement`

## Latest Closed Increment
- `INC-0138`:
  `docs/research/increments/INC_0138_geometry_only_shell_activation_controls.md`
  - status: `Closed: REFINE`
  - verdict: fixed H^4 geometry + adaptive shell activation (learn_so8=0, learn_scale=0) produces
    stable 2-shell structure (shell_pmax≈0.58, no collapse). Real embeddings separate from
    Gaussian noise strongly (buckets: 15.5 vs 50.0, pmax_after: 0.53 vs 0.05) but NOT from
    column-permuted controls at the shell level. Shell assignment is norm-driven. Angular/Hopf
    dimension is the primary carrier of semantic structure.

- `INC-0137`:
  `docs/research/increments/INC_0137_measure_consistent_h4_hopf_shell_pressure_blend.md`
  - status: `Closed: KILL`
  - verdict: bounded geodesic-radius blend (w=0.1–0.4) worsens shell_pmax at all weights
    vs the chart-only HOPF_BASE_K25_PHI baseline (0.5222); w=0.1 passes health but
    degrades pmax to 0.7464; w≥0.2 collapses to 1 shell. Radius-interpolation is not
    the right lever. Next increment must target an occupancy-feedback density controller.

- `INC-0136`:
  `docs/research/increments/INC_0136_measure_consistent_h4_hopf_route_return.md`
  - status: `complete, negative/explanatory`
  - read:
    - direct geodesic shell substitution via `phase4d_hopf_base_ball` failed the
      health gate
    - `shell_pmax=0.8862`, `shell_mass_l1=1.7724`, and `knn_overlap=0.6362`
      were all worse than the healthy Hopf-base control
    - the next honest correction is narrower shell-pressure blending, not more
      downstream packet work

## Earlier-Stage Justification
- Earlier unresolved stage:
  `hyperbolic embedding stability`
- Justification:
  `the architecture-level embedding question remains partial, but the current repo's live fixed-embedding harness makes RR-061 the next software-side falsification gate; we should close the route law before resuming new downstream translated frontier refinement`

## Frozen Supporting Evidence
- Supporting evidence index:
  `docs/research/SUPPORTING_EVIDENCE.md`
- Frozen supporting branch line:
  `INC-0130` through `INC-0134`
- Carry-forward note:
  `these translated sparse-event lower-bank and dual-anchor results remain valid downstream evidence, but they are provisional if RR-061 materially changes the route law`

## Deferred Branches
- `INC-0135`:
  `docs/research/increments/INC_0135_product_phase_sparse_event_translation_lower_bank_quality_systems_frontier.md`
  - reason: `supporting lower-bank translated frontier follow-up after the geometry return`
