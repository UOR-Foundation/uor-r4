# Kill List Tracker

Purpose: single canonical tracker for kill-list stage status.

Use statuses:
- `open` = unresolved and currently blocking or live
- `partial` = positive evidence exists, but not enough to close the stage
- `closed` = sufficiently established for the current repo scope
- `killed` = falsified or explicitly abandoned

## Canonical Queue
- Current primary RR: `RR-061`
- Current primary INC: `INC-0143` (finalize PPMI-SVD discrimination OR production embedding validation)

## 1. Hyperbolic Embedding Stability
- Status: `partial`
- Canonical evidence:
  - `EVIDENCE_SUMMARY.md`
  - `NEXT_CRITICAL_EXPERIMENTS.md`
- Blocker:
  - `large-scale learned hyperbolic embedding stability is not yet revalidated on top of a stabilized route law`
- Next branch:
  - `deferred until the route law is stable enough to justify a dedicated embedding benchmark`

## 2. Measure-Consistent Shell Routing
- Status: `closed/partial-pass`
- Canonical evidence:
  - `docs/research/increments/INC_0060_h4_hopf_measure_diagnostics.md`
  - `docs/research/increments/INC_0061_measure_consistent_route_law.md`
  - `docs/research/increments/INC_0136_measure_consistent_h4_hopf_route_return.md`
  - `docs/research/increments/INC_0137_measure_consistent_h4_hopf_shell_pressure_blend.md`
  - `docs/research/increments/INC_0138_geometry_only_shell_activation_controls.md`
  - `docs/research/increments/INC_0139_TBD.md`
  - `docs/research/increments/INC_0140_angular_sector_routing_measure_consistency.md`
  - `docs/research/increments/INC_0141_TBD.md`
  - `docs/research/increments/INC_0142_TBD.md`
  - `docs/research/increments/INC_0143_TBD.md`
- Latest result (INC-0143, 2026-03-13):
  - 4-seed finalize of PPMI-SVD discrimination on H^4 Hopf routing (dims 3,65,2,21).
  - SEM_ORIG mean_pmax=0.0905, SEM_COL_PERM=0.0613, rel_diff=38.5% (threshold 20%).
  - All 4 seeds pass individually (range 30.6%–54.6%).
  - Stage 2 geometry hypothesis NOT falsified. Stage 2 **CLOSED as PARTIAL-PASS**.
- Stage 2 closure note:
  - H^4 Hopf sector routing discriminates semantically structured embeddings (PPMI-SVD)
    from column-permuted control. The discrimination is seed-stable (4 independent seeds).
  - Caveat: production routing requires semantically structured input embeddings.
    Pure hash features (INC-0136–0141) are isotropic by construction and fail.
  - Shell law (radial discrimination beyond sector) was not demonstrated as strictly
    necessary — pmax_before ≈ pmax_after in all INC-0142/0143 runs (single shell).
    This is acceptable: the Stage 2 gate was angular discrimination, not shell splitting.
- Decision: Stage 2 → **CLOSED/PARTIAL-PASS** (2026-03-13, INC-0143 KEEP).
- Next branch:
  - `Stage 3 (Hopf Angular Correctness) — now unblocked. Queue first Stage 3 RR.`

## 3. Hopf Angular Correctness
- Status: `partial`
- Canonical evidence:
  - `docs/research/increments/INC_0062_hopf_base_angular_law.md`
- Blocker:
  - `none — Stage 2 closed PARTIAL-PASS (2026-03-13). Stage 3 is now unblocked.`
- Next branch:
  - `queue first Stage 3 increment: Hopf angular mass allocation correctness test`

## 4. Phase Transport Usefulness
- Status: `partial`
- Canonical evidence:
  - `docs/research/increments/INC_0063_phase_transport_necessity.md`
  - `docs/research/increments/INC_0064_coupled_complex_phase_transport.md`
  - `docs/research/increments/INC_0065_product_phase_field.md`
- Blocker:
  - `phase and coupled-field motion are mechanism-live. Stage 2 now closed. Reactivate after Stage 3 RR is queued and first increment shows stable routing.`
- Next branch:
  - `deferred until first Stage 3 increment closes`

## 5. Spectral / Operator Usefulness
- Status: `partial`
- Canonical evidence:
  - `docs/research/increments/INC_0066_spectral_route_operator.md`
  - `docs/research/increments/INC_0067_spectral_signal_probes.md`
  - `docs/research/increments/INC_0068_spectral_residual_task_signals.md`
- Blocker:
  - `operator distinction is real, but useful task-signal evidence stayed weak on the proxy target`
- Next branch:
  - `deferred until route law and phase branch are stable`

## 6. Sparse Event-Driven Trainability
- Status: `partial`
- Canonical evidence:
  - `docs/research/increments/INC_0125_product_phase_sparse_event_proxy_trainability_hardening.md`
  - `docs/research/increments/INC_0130_product_phase_sparse_event_translation_route_coupled_soft_bias_pilot.md`
  - `docs/research/increments/INC_0131_product_phase_sparse_event_translation_soft_bias_carry_forward.md`
- Blocker:
  - `proxy and translated sparse-event results are promising, but not yet a closed architecture-level trainability proof`
- Next branch:
  - `deferred until Stage 3 makes progress — RR-061 Stage 2 is now closed`

## 7. Hardware-Efficiency Confirmation

- Canonical evidence:
  - `docs/research/increments/INC_0074_product_phase_translation_dense_frontier.md`

  - `docs/research/increments/INC_0098_product_phase_translation_chart_resident_route_cost_decomposition.md`
- Blocker:
  - `software-side translated wins exist, but they are not yet equivalent to architecture-level hardware replacement`
- Next branch:
  - `deferred until the geometry gate and sparse-event trainability are stronger`
