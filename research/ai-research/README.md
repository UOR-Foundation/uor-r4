# AI-Research

This repository is the root research workspace for the broader project that now
combines:

- `ai-router/` — geometric routing research and experiments
- `MUDBench/` — benchmark and game-world infrastructure for agent evaluation
- `ramsey/` — smaller mathematical research experiments

It also contains root-level notes, figures, scripts, and experimental artifacts
that cut across those subprojects.

## Structure

- `ai-router/`
  Geometry-native routing research, transport laws, and router experiments.
- `MUDBench/`
  Benchmark, simulation, and world/runtime infrastructure.
- `ramsey/`
  Local mathematical experiment harness for recursive Ramsey-style studies.
- repository root
  Shared notes, plots, CSV outputs, and cross-project research artifacts.

## Notes

- This is the new canonical monorepo for the combined project.
- Some large research artifacts remain in version control where they were
  already part of prior project history.
- Local scratch outputs such as `MUDBench/tmp/` are intentionally ignored at the
  root level.
