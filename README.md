R⁴ is an open research project building a **transformerless local AI agent**.
Its goal is to replace transformer attention, mixture-of-experts routing, and
dense learned matrix operations in the serving path with deterministic
geometric routing and lookup.

That is a very real engineering goal, not a claim that the goal has already
been reached. The long-term target is frontier-like capability on ordinary
local hardware. The project is testing whether language context, inference,
and reasoning can emerge from routes through a canonical geometric memory. The
target serving engine uses no Ollama, hosted model, or source-model weights.

> **Primary direction after the V4 one-time reveal (2026-08-29):** routing, exact R4/spin
> state, least-cost selection, and multiscale hierarchy remain the geometric
> substrate, but routing is not being equated with attention. The first natural
> document-scale componentwise-Frechet placement was causally active and still
> harmful: 8.367592% versus frozen #953 at 12.221651%, with its shuffled and
> operator-permuted controls also slightly stronger. The first bounded
> `GeometricGatedDeltaRetentionR4V1` core then passed structural checks but was
> weaker than plain delta on its sealed synthetic fixture (16/28 versus 23/28
> next-token; 55/112 versus 98/112 association wins). Direct-attention V2 then
> appeared positive but is preserved as `NON_PROMOTABLE_BUDGET_MISMATCH`: its
> plain/current comparators had fewer effective degrees of freedom. The fresh,
> pre-reveal-kappa-bound 12-case V3 corrected every arm to normalized R4
> parameters. Full H4 scored 3/12, matched plain attention 12/12,
> current-token-only 6/12, and an inference-time coherent alternative-connection
> swap 10/12; that alternative was not separately trained.
> The direct learning/softmax/value path therefore works, but the current
> mixed-gauge H4 projection/connection/optimizer combination does not transfer;
> the exact H4 group action itself remains algebraically valid.
> `ConnectionGaugeCovarianceV4` then passed its construction/frame gate:
> H4-compatible, alternative-tangent, and fixed-frame arms each fit 16/16 with
> representation covariance. Its independently frozen Phase-III reveal did
> not establish held-out attention. All three main arms scored 13/24;
> current-only scored 12/24; and order-shuffled, value-permuted, and
> source-gauge-mismatch controls scored 13/24, 12/24, and 11/24. The sealed

> now `HELM-D-R4`, grounded in the official MIT HELM-D architectural source at commit
> `7501deca8f413848bfef804be64ce874b72a3cd7`. It first preserves the complete
> learned causal Q/K/V, ordinary stable-softmax, value-aggregation, and output-
> projection path while splitting heads into R4 blocks, encoding them in exact
> cumulative Spin/H4 local frames, transporting K/V into the query frame, and
> mapping the aggregate back before `W_o`. That bounded first positive now
> passes: donor and coherent R4 matched all three held-out next-token top-1
> decisions and decoded `, and`; maximum/mean full-logit deltas were
> `1.049041748046875e-5` / `2.2742100540540378e-6`; donor and R4 replay were
> exact; the source-frame-permuted control decoded `[[` with a `23.0844`

## Try the project

With Git and a current Rust toolchain installed:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/UOR-Foundation/uor-r4.git
cd uor-r4
cargo run --bin r4 -- demo
```

Open <http://127.0.0.1:8000>.

The dashboard lets you interact with the existing geometric router and inspect
its state. It is the quickest way to see the project in motion without
downloading or compiling a language model. A first Rust build may take longer
than five minutes on some machines; later launches reuse it.

To inspect one route from the command line instead:

```bash
cargo run --bin r4 -- route "geometry is the route"
```

To run the one fixed canonical-ingestion witness:

```bash
cargo run --bin r4 -- lexical-ingestion-witness
```

To compile and evaluate the established #989 source-free lexical table path:

```bash
cargo run --bin r4 -- source-free-table \
  --corpus /path/to/articles.jsonl \
  --prompt "The United States" \
  --continuation-cap 16 \
  --artifact-out /path/to/source-free-table.bin \
  --json
```

The corpus directory must also contain its pinned `manifest.json`. The command
uses only the D3 construction partition for its vocabulary and integer
unigram/bigram/trigram counts, evaluates held-out next-unit prediction, writes
the deterministic packed artifact, and emits the exact decoded continuation.
It is a statistical lexical baseline command, not an attention, semantic,
correctness, chat, or release surface.

To run the one frozen #953 comparison against that unchanged table baseline:

```bash
cargo run --bin r4 -- source-free-table \
  --corpus /path/to/articles.jsonl \
  --prompt "The United States" \
  --continuation-cap 16 \
  --artifact-out /path/to/source-free-table.bin \
  --geometric-intervention \
  --geometry-overlay-out /path/to/multiscale-count-radius-r4.bin \
  --json
```

`--geometric-intervention` enables only the frozen
`MultiscaleCountRadiusR4V1` tie-breaking overlay. Both arms retain the table's
first nonempty row, maximum-count tie set, lexical codec, decoder, and shared
declared-work ledger. The report compares held-out choices and both fixed-prompt
continuations; `--geometry-overlay-out` writes the deterministic overlay bound
to the base table artifact. The overlay is a bounded causal geometry experiment. Even a
positive comparison does not establish attention, semantics, correctness,
reasoning, chat quality, performance superiority, formal closure, or release
readiness.

To reproduce the bounded A1R associative ordered-summary decision:

```bash
cargo run --bin r4 -- associative-ordered-summary-a1r-probe
```

To reproduce the corrected A1P paired-H4-derived exact R4-heatmap
identifiability decision:

```bash
cargo run --bin r4 -- candidate-relative-identifiability-a1p-probe
```

To run the #953 decoded loop against a canonical route artifact:

```bash
cargo run --bin r4 -- bounded-geometric-generate \
  --artifact /path/to/canonical-route.json \
  --prompt "active agile athletes run" \
  --continuation-cap 2 --json
```

This research command loads no provider or source weights. It currently accepts
only a canonical artifact whose embedded construction/global input can fully
reconstruct the parent codec registry; subset-observation artifacts fail closed.
Plain output labels both the appendable continuation and typed stop reason;
`--json` emits the full deterministic witness. Trailing prompt whitespace is
also rejected fail closed so the lexical-boundary contract cannot silently
rewrite the prompt. The command is bounded to that reconstructed vocabulary and
the local #969 path; it is not `ask`, `chat`, or a correctness-qualified answer
surface.

The A1R command uses only the frozen construction/evaluation fixture and exact
finite tables. Its frozen report kappa is
`blake3:f0db7a5d5c81d51ebf3b4bf8a2715c4960ec16b14161e8bf7598d7b98c48c881`.
The associative state passed the declared scope, independent-global, fold,
incremental, and support invariants. The full arm produced distinct `ll`/`rr`
relative states on all 6 queries, but shortest Cayley distance mapped both to
energy 2 and tied every query. The terminal verdict is `RETAIN_STATE_ONLY`: it
does not generate text or establish full attention.

The A1P command preserves those six queries as regression-only evidence,
prepares construction and sealed-validation geometry/support without labels,
and derives S4 parity from each exact history and the frozen role order before
joining the separate label ledgers. Its paired contract computes
`X=C(H,c)`, `Y=C(P_c,c)`, and `D=X*Y^-1` in the signed `(1,i)` R4 chart. The
exact endpoint rule is `sin=±1, cos=0 -> 1` with chirality retained and
`sin=0, cos=±1 -> 0` with cosine polarity retained; `q0=q1=0` is typed-null
abstention, not a threshold shortcut. `q2` and `q3` remain in the full `D`
witness but are not scorer-key fields.

The target-free structural census covers 120×120 = 14,400 ordered pairs, 120
relative rows, 45 exact heatmap classes, and 480 typed-null pairs. Across 36
fixture decisions, 14 classes were exercised; construction coverage was 12/12
and pure, construction classes covered 10/12 validation decisions, the
no-class-splitting oracle ceiling was 10/12, strict construction transfer was
0/6, and eight heatmap classes were incompatible. The hard gate therefore
stops before scalar search; every downstream selection, control, and placement
row is `NOT_RUN_IDENTIFIABILITY_HARD_STOP`, not PASS. Its terminal literal is
`RETAIN_H4_STATE_ONLY_ADVANCE_MULTICHANNEL_A1Q`. Contract, universe, and report
kappas are
`blake3:2daacf538c022fab9580d1e124af6c18d0b06da04604fbc962a01bda57f08a98`,
`blake3:dca725c0ec6060166bcd0023df956e1ff029661b5fa7800ccb9f20808712b796`,
and `blake3:5f9239150dea8c0c27c4dfa6ad2e4d0068bc3d18afc127b315c0ec358ceddb3f`.
This negative is bounded to the paired-H4-derived heatmap readout. Fixed-zeta
phases, ordered n-lets, exact `phi` radial transport, and the typed
`sqrt(2) <-> 2i <-> [0,2]` adapters remain structural under
`STRUCTURAL_BINDING_ONLY_NO_ZETA_NLET_TO_PHI_EXPONENT_RULE`; they are not
scorer inputs. It does not establish attention or generation, and #969 becomes
the next stage only after protected #970 merge. #969 has since delivered one
bounded causal path selector. #953 has driven it through real decoded-loop
plumbing and tiered admission on the frozen preflight, but the natural agreement
run made the same full-path choice for both prompts and did not qualify a
natural grammar result.

The ingestion witness maps two turns of text through the pinned lexical codec,
prime/spin route state, canonical hierarchy manifest, strict reload, and exact
lexical reconstruction. It also exercises the declared fail-closed unknown-unit
path. It loads no model and establishes reversible state plumbing only—not
attention, inference, correctness, or reasoning.

The additive serving envelope is
`uor-r4.canonical-lexical-route-manifest/1`; it transitively embeds the frozen
`uor-r4.prime-route-spin-manifest/2` bytes. Its codec identity is
`uor-r4.unicode-lexical-runs/1`: UTF-8 identity normalization, caller-declared
sentence/paragraph/turn boundaries, canonical surface-byte vocabulary order,
and rejection of unknown units before mutation. The parent keeps the complete
codec route-address registry in stable lexical-unit order; the unchanged child
manifest contains only addresses witnessed by its causal sentences. The fixed
input ceiling is 8 turns, 32 paragraphs, 31 sentences, 128 units per sentence,
512 total units, and a 64-unit content-addressed global snapshot.

Downstream code consumes `CanonicalRouteArtifact::decode_canonical`,
`attention_consumer_trace`, `attention_consumer_trace_for_cursor`,
`attention_consumer_trace_with_ordered_h4`,
`incremental_update_trace`, `incremental_cursor`,
`lookup_shared_class_trace`, `scope_ceilings`, and `reconstruct_input`. The
attention handoff is ordered current, previous, last-two, sentence, paragraph,
conversation, then bounded global; the cursor resolver returns those same seven
slots and marks not-yet-established boundaries absent. S0 serializes state and
numeric geometry only: every candidate row ceiling is zero and marked
`NOT_IMPLEMENTED_S0_STATE_ONLY`. #952 established candidate/value reachability
but found its reusable summaries order-erasing. #967 landed the exact ordered
state repair but retained it as state only after the candidate tie. #970's
corrected paired-H4-derived exact R4-heatmap gate stopped at bounded readout
identifiability without searching another scalar. #969 then qualified one local
causal path selector, and #953 implemented the first bounded decoded
library/CLI plumbing. Its relabelled smoke terminated
`REVISE_I1_GENERATOR_IN_PLACE`. `PrimaryThenAdjacentSpinFallbackV1` then
recovered exact `{still}` then `{run,runs}` primary support while consulting
and truthfully tracing adjacent-spin rows, which remained non-admitting until
the primary tier was empty. The one permitted four-arm run produced `still run`
for both full-path prompts and `still runs`
for both state-disabled prompts, with deterministic replay. The terminal
remains `REVISE_I1_GENERATOR_IN_PLACE`. The first frozen local same-object,
order-sensitive candidate-placement preflight then failed before generation or
replay: real placement selected 0/2 intended candidates while its same-artifact cyclic
placement control selected 2/2. #983's later independent construction-return
classes then transferred to 0/6 held-out decisions. #986's later local
qualification stopped before geometry because neither its exact corpus/codec
population nor a complete lexical Cl(0,6)/SpiralCore frame was available.
#953's historical H4/placement fixtures remain untouched. The later B0 reset
accepted a separate fixed-point R4 table-tie intervention and closed #953 at
its positive terminal. #973 Gate 0 has since retained one bounded prior-prefix
copy mechanism. Its frozen paragraph and conversation slices retained one
exact-descriptor/entity-binding path selector apiece at their respective
   scopes. The first bounded-global exact-spin relation failed target-free; its
   independently frozen V2 noncommuting repair then passed the bounded decoded
   contract. The first natural corpus placement later failed in PR #997, and
   the first bounded gated-delta core trailed plain delta on its sealed smoke.
   #973 now owns the direct transported Q/K/V/O oracle, multi-resonance
   replacement, and recurrent factorization while #954 stays blocked.

specific term.

These commands exercise the no-model research substrate. `demo` does not start
the historical artifact-discovery server, and `route` does not claim to answer
the prompt; it exposes how the current geometry represents it.

The browser-only WASM surface is published at
[uor-foundation.github.io/uor-r4](https://uor-foundation.github.io/uor-r4/).
With `just` and `wasm-pack` installed, `just wasm-dashboard` builds and serves
the same local surface without model weights.

## What R⁴ is trying to build

The central hypothesis is simple:

> **The geometry is the route, and the data is the location.**

Text is reversibly assigned to canonical geometric addresses. As a sequence
unfolds, its route carries local and accumulated context. A bounded geometric
query evaluates possible next locations, chooses an admitted least-cost route,
and decodes that location back to text.

```text
text
  → reversible lexical address
  → prime / semiprime route
  → spin, phase, torsion, and radial state
  → current + sentence + conversation + global context
  → bounded next-route selection
  → text
```

The working design brings together:

- primes and semiprimes as addressable atoms and route experts;
- spherical harmonics as the working description of related spin states;
- fixed zeta-zero channels with changing phase and torsion;
- S³/R⁴ transport, Hopf projection, and golden-ratio radial shells;
- a paired-H4/E8 bridge for coupled geometric state; and
- recursive context at route, sentence, paragraph, conversation, and global
  scopes.

Kappa provides canonical identity and serialization. It is not itself the
tokenizer, semantic distance, attention mechanism, or language model. A pinned
lexical codec supplies reversible text boundaries; the intelligence must come
from the geometry.

## What exists now

The current foundation can represent and rebuild prime-route state, preserve
transported trajectory and overlapping context summaries, and perform bounded
deterministic candidate lookup.

It has **not** yet demonstrated:

- prompt-to-answer source-free chat;
- recursive geometric attention that generalizes beyond recall;
- a qualified natural grammatical generation loop;
- correctness and calibrated abstention;
- multi-step reasoning; or
- frontier-class capability or an energy advantage.

Earlier compiler, graph, proof, conformance, and teacher-derived systems remain
in the repository as research evidence and reusable components. They are not
the current product path and are not prerequisites for trying the dashboard.

## Current roadmap

The programme is deliberately sequential so that infrastructure and testing do
not become substitutes for working intelligence:

1. **Retain the established source-free table baseline (#989)** — 22.261404%
   held-out top-1 versus 5.413561% unigram on 446,342 known targets, exact
   bounded decoding, and byte-identical replay. Preserve its artifact and claim
   boundary as a statistical lexical reference.
2. **Retain the accepted R4 tie intervention (#953)** — 23.211797% held-out
   top-1, +4,242 correct choices over the unchanged table, a distinct bounded
   continuation, matched support and declared-work ledger, and byte-identical
   replay.
3. **Establish geometric attention (#973)** — retain the literal causal Q/K/V/O
   scaffold and V4's positive construction-scale connection-gauge covariance,
   but preserve its terminal held-out negative: H4, alternative, and plain were
   each 13/24 and the destructive controls did not separate. Pin and reproduce
   HELM-D as the bounded architectural reference, then preserve a frozen
   ordinary full decoder's learned Q/K/V,
   ordinary stable softmax, value aggregation, and output projection while
   splitting heads into R4 blocks, binding exact cumulative Spin/H4 frames,
   transporting every causal K/V pair into the query frame, and mapping the
   aggregate back before `W_o`. Require numerical/behavioral parity first on
   frozen real next-token loss, top-1, and decoded output against equal-budget
   plain controls. Only then train the intrinsic R4 distance/centroid operator.
   Bind actual paired-E8/fiber/torsion inputs only after attention qualifies.
   Then replace softmax with the multi-resonance sieve,
   retaining the full S3 fiber/torsion state, and then factor the mode sums into
   `GeometricGatedDeltaRetentionR4V1`. Only an approximation that retains the
   frozen construction-validation effect advances toward the protected D3 join;
   exact/table lowering follows the qualified recurrent path. Do not
   scale the rejected componentwise center.
4. **Establish correctness** — relevance, contradiction handling, and honest
   abstention.
5. **Establish reasoning** — bounded multi-step route composition.
6. **Connect and ship the accepted engine** — chat integration, measured
   optimization, and only then release QA.

The CLI and WASM dashboard remain usable research surfaces throughout this
sequence so each new mechanism can become visible before the final engine is
complete.

The active dependency chain is tracked in
[#820](https://github.com/UOR-Foundation/uor-r4/issues/820). #989 established
the frozen table reference, #953 established one matched R4 tie intervention
over it, and #973 retained one bounded prior-prefix copy mechanism plus bounded
exact-descriptor/entity-binding path selectors at paragraph and conversation
scope. Its first bounded-global relation remains closed-negative history; the
independently frozen V2 repair passed its bounded contract; and PR #997 rejected
the first natural componentwise placement. A bounded gated-delta core is
structurally implemented but negative against plain delta on its sealed smoke.
Direct-attention V2 is non-promotable; its equal-manifold-budget V3 rejects the
tested mixed-gauge H4 projection/connection/optimizer combination against a
working plain arm. Its `10/12` alternative-connection score is diagnostic only
because that arm was swapped at inference time rather than trained separately.
Connection/gauge Phase I is positive within #973, but its protected Phase-III
held-out reveal is negative: every main arm scored 13/24 and the destructive
controls failed to separate. `HELM-D-R4` source-pinned full-decoder softmax
parity in transported R4/Spin frames now passes. The only active successor is
the trained intrinsic R4 distance/centroid operator. Multi-resonance
replacement and recurrent factorization remain gated behind a held-out
geometric attention oracle.
#954 remains blocked behind #973. The exact contract is
[ADR-0005](docs/adr/0005-predictive-geometric-connection-memory.md).

## Contributing

This is an obscure and ambitious research problem, and useful contributions
are welcome. The most valuable work advances the first unblocked roadmap stage
and produces an observable user-facing capability. Expensive experiments and
broad QA stay dormant unless a current decision truly requires them.
