# Wait for a genuinely free machine, then claim the slot and launch the
# full-dose chat run. Never touches another lab's process.
#
# Why this exists rather than just launching: this machine has 8 cores and the
# project runs several labs on it. Measured, running a second trainer alongside
# the first gave the newer process 0.87 cores and turned a 4.7 h projection into
# 43.4 h. Waiting is ~9x cheaper than contending.
#
# The two conditions are deliberately both required:
#   others=0  -- no other geometric-stack process at all, regardless of load,
#                because a peer job that has not yet spun up its threads is
#                still a job that will contend;
#   idle>=N   -- measured idle CPU, tiered. NOT load average: observed here at
#                load 9.26 with 81% idle, because load counts I/O-wait tasks as
#                demand, so a load gate blocks a machine with free cores.
#
# The launcher is resolved next to this script, so a copy of the pair works from
# anywhere -- earlier revisions hard-coded /tmp, which the OS may clear.

  # `others` counts *processes*, but what cost me 9x was *resource contention*
  # (0.87 cores; 4.7 h -> 43.4 h). Those differ. Observed here: a peer job held
  # 0.14 cores for 40 minutes with no evaluation -- a process competing with
  # nothing -- yet `others=0` blocked on it. An all-or-nothing trigger can
  # therefore wait out a job that will never finish, however safe the machine
  # becomes.
  #
  # So the trigger is resource-based, in two tiers:
  #   tier 1 (always)   others=0 exactly -- the normal case
  #   tier 2 (after LONG_WAIT_POLLS)  allow lingering processes, but only on a
  #                     genuinely quiet machine: a LOWER idle bar is not
  #                     enough, so tier 3 also raises the memory floor, buying
  #                     back with measured headroom what it trades away
  # Tiers are keyed on MEASURED IDLE, not load average. Observed on this host:
  # load 9.26 with 81% idle, because load counts uninterruptible (I/O-wait)
  # tasks as demand. A load gate would therefore block a launch onto a machine
  # with ~6.5 free cores -- the same mistake as gating on swap occupancy.
  # Idle is the quantity the decision actually depends on: my run uses 8

  # to be. `top -l 2 -n 0` is stable across repeated runs (40-53% idle observed
  # back to back) and its failure mode is a missing line, which is detectable.

  # Reclaimable memory (free + inactive + speculative + purgeable) is what a new
  # 1.4 GB process can actually take. Swap free is what the kernel can fall back
  # on when it must evict. Both matter, and neither alone is the right test:
  # swap occupancy is sticky -- pages stay swapped with no pressure to reclaim
  # them -- so a swap-only test can refuse to launch on an idle machine, while a
  # reclaimable-only test would launch into a box whose swap is exhausted and
  # whose compressor is already holding gigabytes.
  #
  # Measured on this machine during the queue: reclaimable 2168 MB against a
  # 1400 MB need (1.5x, tight), swap free 762 MB, wired 8977 MB, compressor
  # 4245 MB. This is not about my own throughput: when memory runs out the
  # kernel kills the largest task present, which here is a peer lab's
  # multi-hour run.
