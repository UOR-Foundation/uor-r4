# Wait for a genuinely free machine, then claim the slot and launch the
# full-dose chat run. Never touches another lab's process.
#
# Why this exists rather than just launching: this machine has 8 cores and the
# project runs several labs on it. Measured, running a second trainer alongside
# the first gave the newer process 0.87 cores and turned a 4.7 h projection into
# 43.4 h. Waiting is ~9x cheaper than contending.
#
# The two conditions are deliberately both required:
#   others=0  -- no other geometric-stack process at all, regardless of load,
#                because a peer job that has not yet spun up its threads is
#                still a job that will contend;
#   load<4    -- the machine is otherwise quiet. Verified attainable: the app
#                harness's own floor is about load 1.5, so this is reachable and
#                not an impossible bar. `test-monitor-logic.sh` unit-tests both
#                boundaries.
#
# The launcher is resolved next to this script, so a copy of the pair works from
# anywhere -- earlier revisions hard-coded /tmp, which the OS may clear.

  # 43.4 h). A peer trainer is therefore always disqualifying, at any load.
