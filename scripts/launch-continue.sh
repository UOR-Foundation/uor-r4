# Continue the WINNING ARM's chat-v0 LM to a higher dose, then re-run the
# response phase -- to produce the dose-response the objective asks for.
#
# Why this shape rather than a from-scratch full epoch:
#  * the objective's question is whether the arm is UNDERTRAINED. The winning arm
#    saw 9.2M tokens (11.1% of the store, 1.28 tokens/parameter). Continuing from
#    its own weights tests exactly that, and reuses the 57 min of Phase A already
#    spent instead of redoing it;
#  * a from-scratch run would also REMOVE the prose init, confounding "more dose"
#    with "lost the base that produced the winning arm";
#  * starting from the trained weights means every step is additional dose, so
#    the whole budget buys the thing being measured.
#
# init= loads the weights ONLY: Adam moments restart at zero and the LR jumps
# to its warmup target. Measured on the first attempt at lr=0.002, a converged
# model got WORSE over 1,000 further steps (2.304152 -> 2.437755, +0.1336). That
# is a restart artefact, not dose, and it would have been reported as evidence
# against more dose if the starting value had not been checked.
#
# So the continuation runs at lr=0.0002 -- an order of magnitude below the
# from-scratch rate -- keeping each step small enough that the additional dose
# dominates the restart perturbation. Stated plainly: this is a CONTINUATION,
# not an exact resume, and the LR is chosen for that reason.
