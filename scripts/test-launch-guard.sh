# Every condition here has, at some point, been written in a form that could
# never fire or could fire when unsafe -- a load gate that blocked a machine
# with 81% idle, a swap gate that read sticky occupancy, an idle parser that
# returned 0 on a failed match, and iostat columns that are not percentages.
# So each is tested at its boundary and in its failure mode.
