//!
//! The shape options describe the transformer control (#1017's by default). A
//! geometric stack takes the same width, heads, depth and context, the
//! pattern `rra` repeated by default, and the MLP width that matches the
//! control's parameter count.
//!
//! `train` samples windows uniformly from TRAIN with a seeded generator, so two
//! arms with one seed see identical windows. Evaluation windows are evenly
//! spaced over VALID, the rule of `joint-read-geometry`, so `final_windows=512`
//! at context 256 scores the same 131,072 targets as that example. A stopped run
//! continues with `resume=OLD_ROOT/checkpoint` in a new root, with identical
//! settings and input contents (sizes and SHA-256 of every input file). Every
//! report root is claimed before loading and sealed at the end. Set
//! RAYON_NUM_THREADS to bound the threads.
//!
//! With `init=ROOT/model`, `train` starts from that model's weights with a
//! fresh optimizer and schedule and takes its configuration from
//! `ROOT/model/config.json`; architecture options given beside it must agree
//! with the saved model, and `seed=` (default: the saved one) seeds the window
//! sampler. It scores the model at step 0 before any update. `qat=true` trains
//! with the served representation in the forward pass (quantization-aware
//! training, `StackModel::set_served_representation` with the D11 interim
//! codec): the values `export` writes when rounding to nearest, with
//! straight-through gradients. A QAT run's evaluations score the served
//! representation (`dev`, `final`) and the float weights (`dev_float`,
//! `final_float`) on the same windows; its saved model is the float weights,
//! whose round-to-nearest export is the representation it trained, and its
//! `config.json` records that representation (`served_representation`).
//!
//! Matched ablation controls (float training only; `qat=true`, the snap and
//! every export refuse them): `read=l2` scores each source `-beta (|q - k| -
//! offset)`, the flat Euclidean distance in place of the Lorentz read's
//! hyperbolic one, with the same per-head `beta` and `offset`;
//! `rotation_group=u1` (with `rotation=true`) zeroes each raw transport
//! quaternion's `j` and `k` before normalization, so every lane transition
//! lies in the commutative subgroup `{a + b i}`. Both keep the parameter
//! count of the configuration they control (`read=lorentz`,
//! `rotation_group=quaternion`, the default).
//!
//! `key_shift=true` (in `train` and `dialogue-train`) trains every geometric
//! read with the previous-token key channel (`StackModel::set_read_key_shift`):
//! each read key also carries the previous position's key turned by the unit
//! quaternion `j`, with no parameters. The saved model records it in its
//! `config.json` and every later load restores it. After `init=` the setting
//! must equal the saved model's: `key_shift=false` from a shifted model is
//! refused (it would silently change its reads), and `key_shift=true` from an
//! unshifted one is refused too. `key_shift=add` is the explicit way to add
//! the channel to a model trained without it (a design choice: its weights
//! are kept and its reads change from the first step, so the run's report and
//! lineage record `added_to_init`). A resume must present the same setting.
//! It has no served representation or integer export yet, so `qat=true`
//! refuses it and the export modes refuse a model with it.
//!
//! `transport_snap=icosian` (in `train` and `dialogue-train`, after `init=`
//! and on a resume alike) trains with every recurrence's unit transport
//! quaternion snapped to the nearest of the 120 unit icosians of 2I before
//! its scaling by lambda, with straight-through gradients
//! (`StackModel::set_transport_snap`), so the transport is an exact element
//! of 2I. It needs a geometric stack with `rotation=true`, and composes with
//! `qat=true`. The resume lineage records it. Each evaluation scores the
//! model's own forward, snapped (`dev`, `final`; in `dialogue-train`
//! `dev_response_nll`), and the same weights with the transport free
//! (`dev_unsnapped`, `final_unsnapped`; `dev_unsnapped_*`) on the same
//! windows or panel, and reports the icosian usage over the evaluated
//! positions (`transport_usage`: roots selected, entropy of the selection
//! distribution, the identity's share). The saved model is the float
//! weights with `transport.json` beside them recording the snap; loading it
//! does not apply the snap, and `export` refuses it, as the integer engines
//! serve the unsnapped transport.
//!
//! `evaluate` scores consecutive 256-input blocks with a fresh state per
//! block (257 stored ids, 256 targets), the retained evaluator's protocol
//! (`docs/integration/reference-evaluator-v2.json`): it reports the first
//! `tune_blocks` blocks, the remaining comparison blocks and all blocks
//! separately. On the retained TinyStories development store that is 976
//! blocks, 64 tune and 912 comparison (233,472 targets), where #1017 scores
//! 1.574024 nats. Samples decode with `merges=` (the lab BPE) or
//! `tokenizer=` (a `tokenizer.json`, such as the retained 4,096-token one).
//!
//! `export` writes the integer serving artifact of a trained model under owner
//! decision D10 (`uor_r4_training::stack_export`): a stack artifact for a
//! geometric stack, served by `uor_r4_lut::stack`, or a Llama artifact for the
//! transformer control, served by `uor_r4_lut::engine`. Weights round to
//! nearest, or with `calibration=` by GPTQ against the input moments of every
//! weight map over `calibration_windows` evenly spaced windows of that token
//! file, which should be training data. A model whose `config.json` records a
//! served representation (a `qat=true` run's) exports only as that
//! representation using its restored codec, with the record in `export.json`
//! and the artifact's source; `calibration=` is refused. `lut-evaluate` runs
//! either engine position by position over the evenly spaced windows of
//! `train`'s evaluation (`windows=512` is the final evaluation's 131,072
//! targets), with a fresh session per window, and reports its NLL beside the
//! float model's on the same windows when `model=` is given, their top-1
//! agreement and the engine's tokens per second; `blocks=true` uses
//! `evaluate`'s consecutive blocks and tune/comparison split instead.
//! `d11-evaluate` runs a stack artifact through the multiplier-free D11
//! engine (`uor_r4_integer::stack`) and the frozen D10 engine side by side
//! on the same evenly spaced windows, and reports both NLLs, the largest
//! absolute difference between their integer logits (zero for a bit-identical
//! port), each engine's tokens per second and the dense per-token weight
//! reads.
//! `lut-sample` writes greedy and sampled continuations from the integer
//! engine (the integer sampler of `uor_r4_lut::sampling`). Token files may
//! also be UORT stores, the prepared dialogue corpus's format.
//!
//! `dialogue-train` teaches a stack the responses of the prepared
//! literal-role dialogue corpus (`uor_r4_training::stack_dialogue`) with the
//! retained dialogue study's episodes: its contract, eligibility,
//! response-uniform sampler and source-stratified development panel
//! (`dev_seed`, `dev_per_source`). The loss covers response and EOS targets
//! only; each batch drops the padding columns after its longest episode. It
//! starts from a trained stack (`init=`) or a new one, scores the panel every
//! `eval_every` updates, and with `requests=` (the study's request format)
//! writes the float model's greedy replies. `qat=true` trains with the served
//! representation as `train` does (after `init=` and on a resume alike): each
//! evaluation scores the served representation (`dev_response_nll`) and the
//! float weights (`dev_float_response_nll`) on the same panel, the replies
//! come from the served representation, and the saved model's `config.json`
//! records the representation. `lut-chat` talks through either
//! integer engine under the same protocol: replies to `requests=`, or an
//! interactive conversation on standard input (`/reset` starts over; a full
//! 256-position context starts a new conversation). Replies stop as the
//! study's do: at EOS, at a terminal cycle of one to four ids repeated three
//! times, or at `max_new_tokens`. A plain artifact uses protocol 1 unless
//! `protocol=2` is given. A pointer artifact (`uor-r4.lut-stack/2`) is served
//! through its mixture: greedily (ties to the lower id), by the
//! multiplier-free D11 session (`engine=d11`, the default) or the D10
//! comparator (`engine=d10`), under protocol 2 by default, with prompts and
//! stops exactly as the float model's `reply_panel` (`chat-grade grade|reply`)
//! has them, so the integer and float replies compare id for id. Sampling
//! options (`temperature`, `top_k`, `top_p`, `seed`) are refused for a pointer
//! artifact, and `engine=` for a plain one. The D11 engine runs its weight
//! maps on `threads=` threads (default 1); the integers do not depend on it. Its
//! `chat.json` (`uor-r4.geometric-stack-lut-chat/2`) records the engine's
//! thread count, each reply's generated ids, seconds and ids per second, and
//! the panel totals.
//!
//! `policy=` (`dialogue-train`) sets the training episodes' prefix; the
//! development panel always keeps its full prefix. `full_prefix` (the default)
//! keeps the whole document before the response, and `role_only` only BOS and
//! the assistant marker, on the same responses. `truncated_prefix:KEEP` also
//! admits each response whose document is too long but which fits whole after
//! BOS and the marker, and keeps BOS and at most the last KEEP prefix IDs that
//! fit beside it (`truncated_prefix` alone: as many as fit). No response is
//! cut. Its eligible population is recorded as `train_population`.
//!
//! `context=N` (`dialogue-train`) sets the positions the model reads (default
//! 256, at least 256). For a new model it is a shape option; after `init=` it
//! may only grow the saved context (`StackModel::extend_context`: every
//! learned age is kept, and each read head continues along its initial slope,
//! so the model scores sequences up to the saved context exactly as before).
//! Training episodes fill the model's context; the development panel stays
//! the retained study's 256-ID panel.
//!
//! `select=flock:WINDOW:K`, `pointer=DIM`, `pointer_score=dot|lorentz` and
//! `pointer_select=none|flock:WINDOW:K|top:K` (`dialogue-train`, for fresh
//! shapes and after `init=` alike) are the A1 retrieval mechanisms of
//! `uor_r4_training::geometric_stack`, selecting with the shared
//! `uor_r4_training::flock` selector. A flock (`select=`, its sink at position
//! 0) makes every read row (the geometric reads and the control's attention)
//! softmax over the sink, the last WINDOW positions and the K best-scoring
//! other sources only. A pointer adds a copy head after the final norm: a
//! DIM-wide query and key attend the input tokens by the pointer's own score
//! (`pointer_score=`: `dot`, the default, or `lorentz`, the fused read's
//! hyperboloid form with a learned scale) and its own selection
//! (`pointer_select=`, default none, which keeps every source; `top:K` keeps
//! the K best alone, so `top:1` is the single-source pointer). `dialogue-train`
//! refuses `top:1`, given or carried by an `init=` head: its one kept source
//! gives the query, key and scale no gradient, so the single-source pointer is
//! soft-trained weights with `top:1` applied by `m-world evaluate`. The reads'
//! `select=` never applies to the pointer. A gate mixes the copied token's
//! distribution with the ordinary one; the loss, the development scores and
//! the greedy replies are the mixture's. All go into the saved `config.json`
//! and the report. After `init=`, `select=` replaces the saved flock and
//! `pointer_select=` the saved pointer's selection (the weights are unchanged
//! by both), `pointer=DIM` and `pointer_score=` must agree with a saved head,
//! and `pointer=DIM` on a model saved without a pointer adds one with weights
//! drawn fresh from `seed=` (default: the saved model's seed). That seed is
//! recorded in the head's `init_seed` and in the report (`flock_and_pointer`);
//! a resume verifies it (a different one is refused) and carries it forward.
//! `pointer_route=prime:WINDOW` (`dialogue-train`) replaces the pointer's
//! learned scores by the exact prime route of ADR-0003
//! (`uor_r4_training::geometric_stack::PrimeRoute`): a source is admitted when
//! the registered primes of the WINDOW tokens before it share a factor with
//! the query's last WINDOW, and the pointer copies the token that followed;
//! the gate still learns, the query and key get no gradient. `prime-ranked:WINDOW`
//! keeps that admission and ranks the admitted sources by the learned score
//! plus the route's, falling back to the learned pointer where nothing is
//! admitted (the query and key then train). `ngram:WINDOW` and
//! `ngram-ranked:WINDOW` admit by the longest ordered n-let match instead
//! (the n tokens before a source equal the query's last n, for the longest
//! n up to WINDOW with a match; ADR-0003's transition indexes). Each
//! `pointer_select=`, and `none` clears a saved route.
//! `pointer_gate_supervision=W` (`dialogue-train`, default 0 = off) adds
//! copy-gate supervision to the response loss
//! (`StackModel::gate_supervised_loss`): on a scored target whose id an input
//! position `0..=t` holds, `W (BCE(g, 1) - log p_copy(target))`; elsewhere
//! `W BCE(g, 0)`. It needs a pointer over every source and f32 precision.
//! `read_binding_supervision=W` (`dialogue-train`, default 0 = off; Step 7d)
//! adds `W * binding` on steps whose batch holds an answer labelled by
//! `dialogue-recall-corpus binding_labels=1` (`read_binding_labels=DIR`, the
//! split directory holding `binding_labels.json[l]`, for the training store's
//! source `read_binding_source=LABEL`, checked by token count and payload
//! SHA-256): at each input position whose next token is a token of the
//! answer's expected value, `-log(m + 1e-6)` with `m` the attention mass of the
//! binding head of read layer `read_binding_layer=` (default the last read
//! layer) on the expected value's history positions; the binding head is the
//! head with the most mass on the expected and the forbidden values together
//! (`StackModel::read_supervised_loss`). Needs `policy=full_prefix`, full
//! read admission and f32 precision.
//! Each evaluation reports the pointer's mean gate and hit rate on the scored
//! targets (`dev_pointer_*` in the curve, `pointer` in the developments). The
//! pointer has no served representation for training (`qat=true` refuses
//! it). `export` writes a pointer that keeps every source, which both integer
//! engines serve as its mixture (`uor-r4-stack generate` decodes greedily over
//! it, `d11-evaluate` compares the engines' logits and mixtures and scores the
//! mixture); it refuses a pointer selection or route, and a flock, until a
//! D11 port exists. The evaluators that read raw logits (`snap-evaluate`,
//! `rounding-attribution`, and `lut-evaluate` and the artifact samplers, also
//! on a pointer artifact) refuse a pointer model, whose distribution is the
//! mixture. `m-world evaluate` overrides a saved model's selections without
//! training (`select=`, `pointer_select=`). `--help` prints the usage.

The pointer head scores each source of the window with its own score (`pointer_score`: dot, or the fused read's Lorentz form with a learned scale) and softmaxes over the sources its own selection keeps (`pointer_select`: none keeps all, top:1 is the single-source pointer), copies the input tokens at the attended positions, and a gate g = sigmoid(w.h + b) (b starts at -2) mixes that with the ordinary distribution; when no kept source holds a target the mixture is (1 - g) softmax alone, with no floor. `response_mean_nll`, the losses and the greedy replies are the mixture's. `pointer` diagnostics are over the scored dev targets.

  select=flock:WINDOW:K  every read row (geometric reads and the control's attention) softmaxes
                         over the sink (position 0), the last WINDOW positions and the K
                         best-scoring other sources only (the shared crate::flock selector);
                         unkept sources weigh 0. It never applies to the pointer. With init=,
                         replaces the saved flock (select=none clears it); the weights do not
                         change.
  pointer=DIM            a pointer-copy head after the final norm (DIM-wide query and key over
                         the input tokens, and a gate that starts at sigmoid(-2)); the loss, dev
                         scores and greedy replies are the mixture's. With init= on a model saved
                         without one, adds the head with weights drawn fresh from seed= (default:
                         the saved seed); the seed is recorded in the head's init_seed and the
                         report, and a resume must carry the same one. Refused with qat=true and
                         by the evaluators that read raw logits (snap-evaluate,
                         rounding-attribution, lut-evaluate). export writes it when it keeps every
                         source (no pointer_select, no pointer_route); both integer engines serve
                         its mixture.
  pointer_score=...      the pointer's own score of a source: dot (default, q.k/sqrt(DIM)) or
                         lorentz (the fused read's hyperboloid form, with a learned scale
                         pointer.log_beta). With init=, must agree with a saved head.
  pointer_select=...     the sources the pointer softmaxes over (default none: all): the flock
                         WINDOW:K, or top:K (the K best alone; top:1 is the single-source
                         pointer). Its own selection, not select=. Training stays soft unless
                         given, and refuses top:1 (its one kept source gives the query, key and
                         scale no gradient); m-world evaluate applies any selection, top:1
                         included, to saved weights afterwards. With init=, replaces the saved
                         head's selection (the weights do not change).
  pointer_route=...      none (default) or prime:WINDOW, the exact prime route (ADR-0003): a
                         source is admitted when the registered primes of the WINDOW tokens
                         before it share a factor with the query's last WINDOW (1..6), scored by
                         ln gcd plus recency, and the pointer copies the token that followed. The
                         gate learns; the query and key get no gradient. prime-ranked:WINDOW
                         keeps the admission and ranks admitted sources by the learned score
                         plus the route's (learned pointer where none is admitted). ngram:WINDOW
                         and ngram-ranked:WINDOW admit by the longest ordered n-let match
                         (n up to WINDOW) instead of any shared atom. Excludes
                         pointer_select=. With init=, replaces the saved head's route.
  pointer_gate_supervision=W
                         copy-gate supervision (default 0: off, the run is unchanged). On each
                         scored target whose id an input position 0..=t holds, adds W (BCE(g, 1)
                         - log p_copy(target)); on any other scored target W BCE(g, 0). Needs a
                         pointer over every source (no pointer_select/route) and precision=f32.
                         The curve adds train_gate_bce / train_pointer_nll / train_objective and
                         dev_gate_bce / dev_pointer_nll; train_response_nll stays the mixture's.
  read_binding_supervision=W
                         read-binding supervision (default 0: off, the run is unchanged; Step 7d).
                         On steps whose batch holds a labelled answer adds W times the mean over
                         its value-token queries of -log(m + 1e-6), m the binding head's mass on
                         the expected value's history positions in read layer read_binding_layer=
                         (default the last read layer). read_binding_labels=DIR is the split
                         directory of dialogue-recall-corpus binding_labels=1 and
                         read_binding_source=LABEL its source label in the training store.
                         Needs policy=full_prefix, no select= and precision=f32. The curve adds
                         train_binding_{steps,rows,nll,bound_mass,competing_mass,objective}.
  protocol=1|2           the literal-role dialogue version of both corpora (default 1); 2 puts
                         the space after a role marker into the message (m-world corpus
                         protocol=2), so a reply's first word can be copied from context.
  reports                each eval adds dev_pointer_mean_gate / dev_pointer_hit_rate /
                         dev_pointer_reachable_rate to the curve; all settings are in the saved
                         config.json and the report's config and flock_and_pointer.
