# Offline Rust training foundation

This crate contains the offline recurrent-memory learner, its matched transport control, and differentiable research references. No serving crate depends on it. The recurrent learner trains state, causal memory reads/writes and token output jointly. The separate reference modes reproduce the retained #1017 ordinary transformer. Integer export remains a later integration step.

The [frozen campaign](../../docs/integration/joint-recurrent-campaign-2026-09-24.md) specifies the graph, training exposure, resource ceilings, checkpoint selection and capability criteria. `JointModel` exposes the same causal core for differentiable unrolls and detached incremental sessions. It reads only earlier occurrences, updates recurrent state using the read, then writes the current contextual key/value. Exact observed token/occurrence identity is retained alongside learned vector compatibility. A normalized vocabulary/copy mixture supplies the language loss; targets enter only that loss.

The quaternion and Householder-pair arms share dimensions, parameter initialization and data windows. Their local transport scales are matched; their global function families differ. These floating-point offline learners do not establish exact Hamiltonian dynamics or the final integer serving cost. Prime/zeta admission, hard discretization and typed native export remain subsequent integration work.

Each checkpoint includes named model parameters, AdamW moments and per-variable clocks, model/optimizer configuration, exact source/data/tokenizer identities, and the next counter-seeded training window. Resume rejects changes to the model or sampler. The optional `stop_file` requests a checkpoint between updates. `max_process_seconds` stops new updates; the campaign separately reserves final evaluation, save/reload and sealing time.

`joint-evaluate` loads the actual checkpoint, runs free continuations and all frozen source-edit pairs, and then scores every evaluator-v2 development position. NoRead applies from the start of every prompt/block. Per-target records use the explicit44-byte format in `evaluation-report.json`; probability flooring or answer repair is not added by evaluation. The current natural-story probes measure exploratory task transfer. Their failure alone does not diagnose the read mechanism.

Evaluation accepts batches1–32; the paired campaign uses16. `joint-compare` joins all249,856 targets against the two sealed baseline evaluations and four selected learner/control evaluations. It verifies identities and original means, reports paired differences and the prespecified horizon slices, and preserves the original generation/probe hashes. Select checkpoints from the recorded F32 `quick_loss` tune scores before running population evaluation. The comparison never reselects or decides generation quality; its numerical components alone do not complete rung1.

On Apple hosts, optional `cpu-accelerate` enables the pinned, corrected Candle BLAS adapter for offline training. Its four-line source difference and all upstream identities are retained in [the vendor note](../../third_party/candle-core-0.9.2/UOR-PATCH.md). CPU/Rust-gemm and Metal remain explicit alternatives. Backend-specific numerical behavior is reported; cross-backend bitwise training identity is not claimed.

## Integrity mode

```text
uor-r4-training integrity SNAPSHOT TOKENS_U16 OUT_JSON {cpu|metal} WINDOW
```

`WINDOW` is 8–64 inputs; the command reads exactly `WINDOW+1` little-endian token IDs from offset zero and hashes the full source store. Use a new `OUT_JSON` file for each attempt. The file is created exclusively after argument validation and before model loading. Completed and failed results are retained. No optimizer step or checkpoint modification occurs. Finite-difference perturbations are temporary and restored.

The retained snapshot is `/Users/casey.allard/uor-r4/.uor-models/research/issue-1017/export`. Its `model.safetensors` SHA-256 is `cf988a6b5f722b614740b0843807a41feff8276571c846bbee85d410a0030d84`. Loading rejects other weights or shapes. All 56 F32 tensors become named differentiable variables. The tied output reuses `model.embed_tokens.weight`.

CPU is the default build. Optional `metal` enables Candle Metal; a requested device never falls back silently. Optional `reference-accelerate` enables the existing Rust oracle's Apple Accelerate comparison path. Builds used for evidence set `UOR_BUILD_SOURCE_COMMIT` to the actual committed source. Candle core and nn are intentionally pinned to **0.9.2**, an established published release; this is not a claim that it is the newest release.

The forward pass composes differentiable RMSNorm, half-rotation HF Llama RoPE, causal softmax, Q/K/V/O projections and SwiGLU. It avoids Candle's inference-only fused softmax/RMSNorm helpers. Every logit is compared; the report includes per-position maximum error and top-one identities, all parameter gradient norms, Q/K/V gradient availability for all six layers, and three finite-difference coordinates chosen as the largest absolute gradient in layer-zero Q, K and V. The finite-difference tolerances and parity ceiling are constants in the source, fixed before execution. Full final-position logits are retained for independent inspection. The reference oracle reports its actual selected arithmetic owner, including an exact-mode environment override if present.

[Evaluator v2](../../docs/integration/reference-evaluator-v2.json) pins the two inherited training stores, the #1017 checkpoint/tokenizer, exact development positions, calibration grid, generation prompts and historical output identities. Every input is rehashed. Each new report directory is claimed before loading a model, and its complete file set is sealed and verified on success or failure. Preserve the fitted `model.ng5` and its separate `count-selection.json`: the latter fixes the calibrated discount and cache mixture.

The count comparator uses raw five-gram counts, lower-order distinct left extensions from unpruned raw types, a fixed interpolated discount, deterministic count pruning and a normalized unigram floor. Pruned and discounted mass backs off. It is not the multi-discount modified Kneser–Ney algorithm. Training sequences remain separate; evaluation history and the token cache reset at the declared 256-position boundaries. The first 64 development blocks choose the pure-count discount, then the cache mixture with that discount held fixed. Settings are saved before scoring the comparison tail. This tail is separate from current count calibration but was previously exposed during neural checkpoint selection.

Reference evaluation uses detached parameters and batch-isolated causal tensors. It records every actual target logit and full-vocabulary log-normalizer, and checks batch isolation, future-input causality and reproduction of historical population likelihood. Generation recomputes the prefix without a KV cache and preserves every actual sampling decision. Five seeded outputs are persisted before historical golden files are opened; token, response and stop equality are compared separately from the old R4 audit metadata. Its timing is an offline reconstruction cost, not optimized serving throughput.

## Scope and next integration

A successful integrity report establishes agreement for that token window and an operative gradient through **soft** attention. It does not establish hard admission, quantization parity, general language ability, a geometric advantage or final serving compliance. The prior #1017 confirmation set has already been opened; it can serve as a historical regression set, never a fresh final draw. Future corpus evaluation/training modes should extend this crate and preserve separate development and final protocols.

The old safetensors/config/tokenizer and Rust reference loader are reused directly. The Python pickle checkpoint and optimizer state are not loaded. A future quantized bridge must explicitly specify its surrogate, gradient path, code usage and hard exported evaluation rather than assuming autodiff differentiates argmax.

The actual retained architecture is implemented in `tools/r4-softmax-trainer/src/r4_softmax_trainer/model.py`; this crate reproduces it in Rust as an offline comparator.

Executed September 24: the pinned 32-position reference check passed on CPU and Metal; see [the compact evidence](../../docs/evidence/reference-autodiff-integrity-2026-09-24.json) and [evaluator manifest](../../docs/integration/reference-evaluator-v1.json). That integrity mode enforces reference weights and architecture and emits full input identities; its complete manifest was verified independently. The comparison modes enforce evaluator v2 directly. The [current state](../../docs/integration/current-state.md) owns the reference results and the separate recurrent learner's outcome and next execution.
