//! Author the held-out synthetic QUESTION-FORM set, reproducing the frozen bytes.
//!
//! Rust port of `build-qforms.py`, on the #1659 pattern: the bar is BYTE IDENTITY with
//! the frozen JSON, so the set stays reproducible from committed source. That needs
//! CPython's Mersenne Twister (`init_by_array`, not `init_genrand`, and unrelated to the
//! crate's splitmix64) and `json.dumps(indent=1)`, both reused verbatim from the verified
//! `disjoint-panel` bin.
//!
//! The set is a HELD-OUT instrument: the training forms authored for v26 must use
//! templates DISJOINT from these, and disjointness is asserted at build time.
//!
//! Usage: qform-set build out=DIR | verify dir=DIR
