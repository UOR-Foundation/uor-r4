//! Build a synthetic in-context memory corpus: many fact / competing-statement
//! / question documents whose assistant turn is the correct answer.
//!
//! ```text
//! geometric-stack synthetic-memory out=NEW_REPORT_ROOT tokenizer=TOKENIZER.json \
//!   rows=2000 seed=7 [split=train] [vocab_size=4096] \
//!   [distance=N | curriculum=1 [max_distance=N]] [token_budget=N]
//! ```
//!
//! `distance` controls how far the asserted fact sits from the question. In the
//! legacy form the document is exactly four turns, so the asked statement is
//! always 0 or 1 turns from the question -- inside the reach of a short causal
//! convolution, which means a fit can score it without ever reading the fact out
//! of state. `distance=N` inserts `N` filler user turns between the statement
//! pair and the question, so the fact is N+0 or N+1 turns back and the local
//! window cannot carry it. `curriculum=1` draws each document's filler count
//! uniformly from `0..=max_distance` (default 8), giving a mixture that keeps the
//! easy case in distribution while forcing the hard ones.
//!
//! Both knobs are additive: with `distance=0` and no curriculum every byte of
//! `tokens.u16`, `response_mask.u8` and `manifest.json` is exactly what the
//! pre-distance generator wrote for the same rows and seed, so prior artifacts
//! stay comparable.
//!
//! Distance is capped at `MAX_DISTANCE` because `dialogue-train` under
//! `policy=full_prefix` **excludes** any document whose start-to-answer span
//! exceeds the model context (256), and a document that is never trained on is
//! not evidence about distance. `token_budget` stops the run after the last
//! document that keeps the total at or below the given token count, which is how
//! two arms are generated at the same budget when the filler turns make the
//! ramped documents longer.
//!
//! Why this exists: the value-faithfulness diagnostic (#1512) found that a
//! competing turn costs the emitter about 2/10 of answer-target stability
//! (fact+question 7/10, fact+competing+question 4-5/10), and that the deficit is
//! *not* retrieval, selection or question binding. Testing whether it is
//! trainable needs a **distribution** of such bindings, and the development
//! panel is ten rows -- roughly 500 tokens, about 0.0006% of the 82.5M-token
//! chat-v0 response store, far too little to move a fitted model.
//!
//! The documents are written in the corpus format the trainer already loads
//! (schema `uor-r4-chat-corpus/v1`): `<|bos|>` then turns joined by a single
//! newline, each turn `<marker><content>` with markers `User: ` / `Assistant: `,
//! every assistant turn ending with `<|eos|>`; `tokens.u16` holds the ids and
//! `response_mask.u8` is 1 on each assistant response token and its terminating
//! EOS, 0 elsewhere. Encoding goes through the same `DialogueProtocol` and
//! `DialogueEncoder` the rest of the project uses, so role markers, separators
//! and masking are not re-implemented here.
//!
//! Both the asked relation and the competing statement are always *stated*, and
//! the answer is always the asked relation's value, so a model that learns the
//! corpus is learning to answer the asked relation rather than to prefer the
//! most recent value. Which relation is asked varies, and the competing
//! statement's relation is drawn independently.
