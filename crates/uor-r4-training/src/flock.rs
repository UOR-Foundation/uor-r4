//! The shared causal flock selector: one pure rule for read/support selection.
//!
//! Flock attention keeps, for each query row, a **sink**, a **local window** and
//! the **exact top-k** of the remaining causally visible positions. This module
//! owns that rule once, for every consumer:
//!
//! - the B0 training-free probe over a checkpoint's own scores (the candle
//!   adapter in [`crate::kappa_llama`]);
//! - Claude/Lab 1's A1 retrieval read/support semantics;
//! - the Codex B2 harmonic + flock hybrid, which needs the deduplicated causal
//!   support in descending Lorentz rank with explicit **unnormalized** weights;
//! - the model-source `score_and_normalize` seam and the later D11 port.
//!
//! # Contract
//!
//! - **One selection rule.** [`flock_select`] takes one query row's rank scores
//!   (positions `0..=query`; a monotone rank score such as the Minkowski
//!   product `-q0 k0 + q . k`, which needs no `arcosh`), the general selection
//!   parameters [`FlockSelect`] `{ sink, window, k }`, and returns a
//!   [`FlockSelection`].
//! - **Deduplicated support.** The support is the *set* `{sink} ∪ window ∪
//!   top-k`. The window is the `window` nearest preceding positions; the sink
//!   takes precedence if it falls inside that range, so no position appears
//!   twice.
//! - **Deterministic order.** Selection entries are ordered by descending rank
//!   score with ties broken to the **lowest position**. The same inputs always
//!   produce the same selection.
//! - **Arms stay distinct.** [`FlockWeights::Softmax`] is the checkpoint's own
//!   softmax restricted to the kept set (arm S). [`FlockWeights::Rank`] is the
//!   normalized rank table `w_i ∝ 1/(i + 1)` (arm R, no exponentials). The
//!   **raw, unnormalized** scale `a_i = 1/(i + 1)` is exported separately by
//!   [`raw_rank_weights`] / [`FlockSelection::raw_rank_weights`] for the B2
//!   hybrid correction `N += Σ(a − h)v`, `Z += Σ(a − h)`; it is not the
//!   within-support normalized probability. No denominator clamp is applied
//!   here.
//! - **Honest cost.** [`FlockScan::candidates_scanned`] counts every rest
//!   position the exact selector compared. Selecting `k` values does **not**
//!   establish `O(k)` search; an index (B1) must account for its own build,
//!   scan and recall separately.
//!
//! The B0 pre-registration fixes `sink = 0`, `window = 64` and
//! `k ∈ {1, 7, 16, 64}`; [`FlockSpec`] carries those choices plus the weight
//! arm, and [`FlockSpec::select`] materializes the sink-at-zero selection.
//!
//! This module has no tensor dependency: rows are plain `&[f32]` slices, so the
//! same logic is usable offline and in a later bounded integer/table runtime.
