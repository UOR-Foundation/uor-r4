//! A multi-layer native geometric language model trained a whole window at a
//! time (the geometric stack), and an ordinary transformer control with the
//! retained #1017 reference's shape. Both are trained from scratch on the same
//! data. Offline training only; nothing here is a serving path.
//!
//! The retained native model (`joint_model`) is one gated recurrent layer with
//! one read, trained position by position. This module tests whether a stack of
//! the same kinds of operators closes the gap to an ordinary transformer of
//! equal size. Its layers take their gates and projections from the layer input
//! alone, so each projection is one matrix product per window; only the cheap
//! recurrence scan runs position by position, batched and parallel over
//! windows.
//!
//! Geometric layers are pre-norm and residual, and each ends with a SwiGLU MLP.
//! The temporal mixer is one of two kinds, chosen per layer by `pattern`:
//! - `r`, quaternion transport recurrence. Each lane of four channels carries a
//!   quaternion state `h_t = lambda_t (u_t * h_{t-1}) + sqrt(1 - lambda_t^2) a_t`.
//!   `u_t` is an input-dependent unit quaternion (near the identity at
//!   initialization), `lambda_t` a gated decay in (0, 1), and `a_t` the input
//!   after a width-4 causal convolution. The window runs through one exact scan
//!   ([`quaternion_scan`]) whose backward is the reverse scan.
//! - `a`, a multi-head read over positions `<= t`. It has a Lorentz
//!   (hyperbolic) or Dot score, a learned age term per head and distance, and a
//!   NoRead slot with a zero value. One fused op ([`fused_read`]) computes it,
//!   with an exact backward.
//!
//! The control layer is RoPE softmax attention plus a SwiGLU MLP, #1017's
//! layout. Its attention uses the same fused op with the Dot score and no NoRead
//! or age, so both models run on the same kernels.
//!
//! Quantization-aware training: with a served representation set
//! ([`StackModel::set_served_representation`]), a geometric stack's forward
//! pass reads exactly the values its integer export writes
//! ([`crate::stack_export::export_stack`]): weight maps through a
//! [`MapCodec`] (by default [`D11Interim`], the export's own 4-bit groups)
//! with the norm gains folded in, per-channel scalars through their grid codes
//! and biases, age tables and Lorentz offsets in fixed point. Gradients reach
//! the float variables by a straight-through estimator. A model saved in
//! served mode records its codec in `config.json`
//! ([`SavedServedRepresentation`]), so that an export can refuse to write a
//! representation the model did not train against
//! ([`crate::stack_export::check_export_representation`]).
//!
//! Trained-in transport snap: with a snap set
//! ([`StackModel::set_transport_snap`]), every recurrence replaces each unit
//! transport quaternion `u_t`, before its scaling by `lambda_t`, by the
//! nearest of a fixed set of unit quaternions. For [`TransportSnap::Icosian`]
//! that set is the 120 unit icosians of the binary icosian group 2I, so every
//! transport is an exact element of 2I. The gradient passes the snap
//! unchanged to `u_t` and on through its normalization to the rotation logits
//! (straight-through, `u + (snap(u) - u).detach()`). The fused recurrence core
//! applies it, so training runs at the fused path's speed; with no snap set the
//! core computes exactly what it computed before the snap existed.
//!
//! Flock selection (A1): with [`StackConfig::select`] set, every read row `t`
//! of every `a` layer and head (and of the control's attention) softmaxes over
//! a kept subset of the sources `0..=t` only. The subset is the shared
//! selector's ([`crate::flock::flock_select`], sink 0): the sink, the last
//! `window` positions and the `k` best-scoring remaining sources on the same
//! total score the softmax uses (ties to the lowest position); the NoRead slot
//! is not a position and stays outside the selection. Unkept sources get
//! weight exactly 0 and, in the backward, gradient exactly 0; the backward
//! calls the same function on the same scores, so its selection is identical.
//! Selection is compare and select only, so it has a D11 port in principle; no
//! port exists yet, so the exports refuse a model with a flock. With `select:
//! None`, or a selection that keeps every source of a row, the read computes
//! what it computed before the flock existed, bit for bit. The reads' `select`
//! never applies to the pointer.
//!
//! Pointer-copy head (A1): with [`StackConfig::pointer`] set, the final hidden
//! state `h_t` also drives a copy distribution. `q_t = W_q h_t` and
//! `k_j = W_k h_j` (width to `dim`, no bias) give the pointer's own score of
//! each source `j <= t`: `q_t . k_j / sqrt(dim)` for [`ReadScore::Dot`], and
//! for [`ReadScore::Lorentz`] `-beta arcosh(1 + e)` with the excess `e =
//! lift(q_t) lift(k_j) - q_t . k_j - 1`, `lift(x) = sqrt(1 + |x|^2)` (the form
//! of the fused Lorentz read) and the learned positive scale `beta =
//! exp(pointer.log_beta)`. The attention `a_t` is the softmax of the scores
//! over the sources the pointer's **own** [`PointerConfig::select`] keeps
//! ([`PointerSelect`]: the shared flock, or the `k` best alone, `TopK(1)`
//! being the single-source pointer; `None` keeps every source), so a single
//! kept source has weight 1. `p_copy(v | t) = sum_j a_tj [x_j = v]` copies the
//! input tokens at the attended positions. A gate `g_t = sigmoid(w_g . h_t +
//! b_g)` (`b_g` starts at -2) mixes it with the ordinary distribution: `p(v |
//! t) = (1 - g_t) softmax(z_t)[v] + g_t p_copy(v | t)`. When no kept source
//! holds the target, `p_copy` is exactly 0 and the mixture is `(1 - g_t)
//! softmax(z_t)[v]`; there is no probability floor. [`StackModel::weighted_loss`],
//! [`StackModel::loss`] and [`StackModel::target_nll`] score that mixture (in
//! log space), and [`StackModel::next_scores`] is the greedy generation entry
//! point. [`StackModel::forward`] still returns the raw logits `z`. Training
//! may stay soft (`select: None`); [`StackModel::set_pointer_select`] applies a
//! selection to the same weights afterwards. The pointer has no served
//! representation: `qat=true` and the integer exports refuse a model with one.
