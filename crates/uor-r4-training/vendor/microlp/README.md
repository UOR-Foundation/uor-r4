A linear programming solver: it finds the minimum (or maximum) of a linear
function of a set of variables subject to linear equality and inequality
constraints. Variables can be real, integer or boolean.

### Disclaimer

I cannot guarantee that the solver always gives optimal solutions (nor that it is bug free), but I'm trying to expand the test suite to cover most cases and catch any bugs that come with it. If you find a bug, want to contribute new testcases or new features, consider reporting it or contributing and sending a PR.

## Getting started

You can use [microlp](https://crates.io/crates/microlp) on its own, but it's
recommended to use it with the [rooc modeling language](https://github.com/specy/rooc) or 
[good_lp](https://github.com/rust-or/good_lp), as they make it easier to write models.

The sections below show how to use microlp directly.

## Features

* Pure Rust. Runs on WebAssembly.
* Real, integer and boolean variables.
* Time limits and MIP gap, with possibility to edit and resume the solve.
* Warm starts from a known solution.
* Handles problems with hundreds of thousands of variables and constraints.

Integer and boolean variables are handled with branch & bound. The library is
already quite powerful and fast, but it may still cycle or lose precision on
some hard problems. Please report bugs and contribute code!

## Basic usage

```rust
use microlp::{Problem, OptimizationDirection, ComparisonOp};

// Maximize x + 2y, where x is real with x >= 0 and y is an integer
// with 0 <= y <= 3.
let mut problem = Problem::new(OptimizationDirection::Maximize);
let x = problem.add_var(1.0, (0.0, f64::INFINITY));
let y = problem.add_integer_var(2.0, (0, 3));

// Subject to x + y <= 4 and 2x + y >= 2.
problem.add_constraint(&[(x, 1.0), (y, 1.0)], ComparisonOp::Le, 4.0);
problem.add_constraint(&[(x, 2.0), (y, 1.0)], ComparisonOp::Ge, 2.0);

// The optimum is 7, at x = 1, y = 3.
let solution = problem.solve().unwrap().into_solution().unwrap();
assert_eq!(solution.objective(), 7.0);
assert_eq!(solution.var_value(x), 1.0);
assert_eq!(solution.var_value(y), 3.0);
```

## Defining a problem

A `Problem` is created with an optimization direction and filled with
variables and constraints. Each variable is defined by its objective
coefficient and its bounds, and is represented by a `Variable` handle that you
keep to reference it later.

```rust
use microlp::{ComparisonOp, LinearExpr, OptimizationDirection, Problem};

let mut problem = Problem::new(OptimizationDirection::Minimize);

let x = problem.add_var(1.5, (0.0, f64::INFINITY)); // real, x >= 0
let y = problem.add_integer_var(1.0, (-10, 10));    // integer, -10 <= y <= 10
let z = problem.add_binary_var(2.0);                // boolean: 0 or 1
```

The left-hand side of a constraint can be given as a slice of
`(variable, coefficient)` pairs, as any iterator of such pairs, or as a
`LinearExpr` built term by term:

```rust
problem.add_constraint(&[(x, 1.0), (y, 1.0)], ComparisonOp::Le, 4.0);

let vars = [x, y];
problem.add_constraint(vars.iter().map(|&v| (v, 2.0)), ComparisonOp::Ge, 2.0);

let mut lhs = LinearExpr::empty();
lhs.add(x, 1.0);
lhs.add(z, -3.0);
problem.add_constraint(lhs, ComparisonOp::Eq, 0.0);
```

## Solving and reading the solution

`solve()` tries to find the optimal solution, it returns `Error::Infeasible` when the constraints contradict each other and `Error::Unbounded` when the objective can grow forever. Invalid numeric options return `Error::InvalidOptions`, and unrecoverable numerical failures return `Error::InternalError`.

When a solver decides to produce a solution it might be for different reasons:

* `SolveOutcome::Solution` contains a validated assignment. Its status is
  `SolutionStatus::Optimal` when exact optimality was proved, or
  `SolutionStatus::Feasible` when a valid incumbent is available without an
  exact proof, for example if a time or node limit has been reached.
* `SolveOutcome::Interrupted` means a time or node limit fired before a usable
  incumbent existed. It exposes the termination reason and statistics, but no
  objective or variable-value accessors as they are not available. This case is
  not "impossible" to solve, just that not enough time was spent to find a
  solution. In this case you might want to use `resume()` to continue the search.

`termination_reason()` distinguishes `ProvenOptimal`, `MipGap`, `TimeLimit`,
and `NodeLimit`.
```rust
use microlp::{SolutionStatus, SolveOutcome};

match problem.solve()? {
    SolveOutcome::Solution(solution) => match solution.status() {
        SolutionStatus::Optimal => println!("optimum: {}", solution.objective()),
        SolutionStatus::Feasible => println!(
            "best so far: {} (gap: {:?}, reason: {:?})",
            solution.objective(),
            solution.gap(),
            solution.termination_reason()
        ),
    },
    SolveOutcome::Interrupted(interrupted) => {
        println!("no solution yet: {:?}", interrupted.termination_reason());
    }
}
```

Values on a `Solution` are read per variable or by iterating. For integer and boolean
variables `var_value` returns an exact integer, and the reported objective is
computed from exactly the values you read:

```rust
let value = solution.var_value(x);   // rounded to an exact integer for
                                     // integer/boolean variables
let raw = solution.var_value_raw(x); // without the rounding
let same = solution[x];              // indexing is equivalent to var_value_raw()

for (var, value) in &solution {
    println!("{}: {}", var.idx(), value);
}
```

`stats()` returns counters for the solve so far: branch & bound nodes, simplex
iterations, elapsed time, the best proven bound and the current gap.

## Time limits and resuming

Set a time budget with `set_time_limit`. When it runs out, the outcome
contains either a feasible incumbent or an interrupted search. `resume()`
continues the same search with the per-call options used by the immediately
preceding solve or resume.

Use `resume_with` to resume with different settings.

```rust
use microlp::{ResumeOptions, TerminationReason};
use std::time::Duration;

problem.set_time_limit(Duration::from_millis(100));
let mut outcome = problem.solve()?;

while matches!(
    outcome.termination_reason(),
    TerminationReason::TimeLimit | TerminationReason::NodeLimit
) {
    // Do something between slices: log progress, check for shutdown, ...
    let mut options = ResumeOptions::default();
    options.time_limit = Some(Duration::from_millis(100));
    outcome = outcome.resume_with(options)?;
}
```

Time limits are checked periodically, so a solve can run slightly past its budget.

## Solve options

`solve_with` accepts a `SolveOptions` for everything beyond a plain time
limit. Start from the default and change what you need:

```rust
use microlp::SolveOptions;
use std::time::Duration;

let mut options = SolveOptions::default();
options.time_limit = Some(Duration::from_secs(10));
options.node_limit = Some(50_000); // deterministic alternative to a time limit
options.mip_gap = 0.01;            // accept anything within 1% of optimal
options.warm_start = Some(vec![(x, 1.0), (y, 3.0)]);

let outcome = problem.solve_with(options)?;
```

* `time_limit`, `node_limit`: execution budgets for this call.
* `mip_gap`: stop as soon as the solution is proven within this relative
  distance of the optimum, and report a feasible solution with termination
  reason `MipGap`. The default `0.0` requires exact optimality.
* `warm_start`: a starting assignment (it may cover only some variables).
  A good one gives the solver an immediate solution to improve on. It is
  advisory: if it isn't usable it is ignored.
* `int_tol`, `tolerances`: numeric tolerances. Values must be finite and non-negative, and the two integrality
  tolerances must be below `0.5`.

## Changing a solved problem

A `Solution` can be edited and re-solved: `add_constraint` adds a new
constraint, `fix_var` pins a variable to a value, `unfix_var` releases a
previous fix. Each call consumes the solution and returns a new, re-solved
one, keeping as much earlier work as possible, in particular, the previous
solution is used as a starting point whenever it is still valid for the
changed problem.

Only a `Solution` can be edited. An interrupted outcome deliberately has no
edit methods because it has no validated assignment. A feasible-but-unproven
`Solution` can be edited. Every edit returns another `SolveOutcome`, so a
limited reoptimization remains explicit and safe.

```rust
use microlp::{
    ComparisonOp, Error, OptimizationDirection, Problem, SolveOutcome,
};
use std::time::Duration;

fn resume_until_answer(mut outcome: SolveOutcome) -> Result<SolveOutcome, Error> {
    while outcome.solution().is_none() {
        outcome = outcome.resume()?;
    }
    Ok(outcome)
}

fn main() -> Result<(), Error> {
    // How many units of each product to make (0 to 10 each), maximizing
    // profit under a machine-hours budget.
    let mut problem = Problem::new(OptimizationDirection::Maximize);
    let profit = [12.0, 9.0, 7.0, 15.0];
    let hours = [4.0, 3.0, 2.0, 6.0];
    let units: Vec<_> = profit
        .iter()
        .map(|&p| problem.add_integer_var(p, (0, 10)))
        .collect();
    problem.add_constraint(
        units.iter().zip(&hours).map(|(&v, &h)| (v, h)),
        ComparisonOp::Le,
        100.0,
    );

    // First pass, with a time budget. (This toy instance solves instantly;
    // on a real model this may first return Interrupted.)
    problem.set_time_limit(Duration::from_secs(1));
    let outcome = resume_until_answer(problem.solve()?)?;
    let solution = outcome
        .into_solution()
        .expect("resume_until_answer guarantees a solution");
    println!("plan is worth {}", solution.objective());

    // Requirements change after seeing the plan: a customer needs at least
    // 3 units of product 0, and product 3 is out of stock. Edits apply to
    // the problem as you originally defined it, plus the other edits.
    let outcome =
        solution.add_constraint(&[(units[0], 1.0)], ComparisonOp::Ge, 3.0)?;
    let solution = resume_until_answer(outcome)?
        .into_solution()
        .expect("resume_until_answer guarantees a solution");
    let outcome = solution.fix_var(units[3], 0.0)?;
    let solution = resume_until_answer(outcome)?
        .into_solution()
        .expect("resume_until_answer guarantees a solution");
    println!("revised plan is worth {}", solution.objective());

    // Product 3 is available again: release it and read the new solution.
    let (outcome, _was_fixed) = solution.unfix_var(units[3])?;
    let solution = resume_until_answer(outcome)?
        .into_solution()
        .expect("resume_until_answer guarantees a solution");
    for (i, &unit) in units.iter().enumerate() {
        println!("product {}: {} units", i, solution.var_value(unit));
    }
    Ok(())
}
```

An edit that makes the problem unsolvable returns `Err(Error::Infeasible)`
from the edit call itself.

## Testing

Besides unit tests, the repository ships a correctness suite of 200+ LP/MILP
problems with independently known answers:

```bash
cargo test --release --test suite            # default set, a few seconds
cargo test --release --test suite -- --hard  # plus the long-running ones
```

See [tests/suite/README.md](tests/suite/README.md) for how it works, and
[src/ARCHITECTURE.md](src/ARCHITECTURE.md) if you want to know how the solver
itself works.

There is also a harder tier called `xhard` which microlp currently cannot solve in reasonable time. (under 10 minutes) which you can run with. This tier is being used to compare with other solvers.
```
cargo test --release --test suite -- --xhard
```

## Benchmarks

[BENCHMARK.md](https://github.com/Specy/microlp/blob/master/BENCHMARK.md)
compares microlp against other open-source solvers on the suite's benchmark
instances, and tracks how close it gets on the instances it cannot yet solve
within a time budget. Regenerate it from a clone of this repository (the
crates.io package does not include the benchmark data) with:

```bash
cargo run -p microlp-benchmark --release
```

The rival solvers set themselves up during the build: HiGHS is compiled from
source, SCIP is downloaded prebuilt (the first build needs internet access)
and Clarabel is pure Rust. What must already be on the machine is a C++
toolchain, CMake and libclang:

* **Linux** (Debian/Ubuntu): `sudo apt install cmake build-essential libclang-dev libgfortran5`
* **macOS**: `xcode-select --install`, then `brew install cmake`
* **Windows**: Visual Studio Build Tools (C++ workload), [CMake](https://cmake.org)
  and [LLVM](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/releases) for
  `libclang.dll` — or `pip install libclang` and point `LIBCLANG_PATH` at
  its `native` folder

Runs are timed, so use an otherwise idle machine.
A solver you cannot build
can be left out, e.g.
```bash
cargo run -p microlp-benchmark --release --no-default-features --features highs,clarabel
```
