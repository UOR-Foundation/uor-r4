//! Multiresolution cover induction (graph-compiler plan §5 Phase 2,
//! issue #60 first slice): turn the flat per-stage classes into a
//! multiresolution, overlapping region cover with calibrated memberships.
//!
//! # Observation vector lane
//!
//! Cover input vectors come from the **existing deterministic
//! context-bundle path** — the `[i64; D]` dyadic bundle of
//! [`runtime::bundle_plain`] over corpus positions, centered by the
//! compiled per-dimension thresholds and L2-normalized to f32. This is
//! exactly the geometry the current signature encoder consumes in
//! [`compiler::compile`] step 4, so the region cover and the incumbent
//! 4×256 class cover route the same vectors. An observation's semantic
//! code `H(x)` is [`runtime::sig_plain`] of the same bundle: L2
//! normalization divides by a positive scalar, so sign bits of the
//! normalized vector equal sign bits of the centered bundle, and the
//! binarized region prototypes below drop straight into the runtime's
//! masked-Hamming membership path. Loading `hidden_state()` traces is
//! explicitly OUT of this slice; the trace surface (`teacher.rs`
//! `hidden_state`/`top_k`) is the v2 enrichment seam — the vector lane is
//! isolated in [`build_observations`] so a trace-backed lane can replace
//! it without touching induction.
//!
//! # Induction
//!
//! - **Spherical k-means** over the normalized vectors, mini-batched:
//!   batches are contiguous observation ranges whose size derives from
//!   `--memory-budget` (see [`derive_batch_size`]); the E-step accumulates
//!   per-centroid f64 partial sums in global observation order across
//!   batches, so the batch size is a pure resource knob and never changes
//!   results. Observation extraction is sharded across bounded scoped
//!   workers; the resulting chunks are merged in canonical position order.
//!   K-means iterations and all reductions remain ordered, which keeps T=1
//!   and T=N byte-identical (plan §4.1 ordered reductions).
//!   Centroid state is `k × D × 4` bytes; v1 holds the f32 observation
//!   matrix resident (1.2 KB/observation, documented below) — the §4.1
//!   quantized/spilled shard lane is the `observe.rs` pipeline
//!   integration, a v2 item.
//! - **Seeding is content-addressed**: the first centroid is the
//!   observation selected by a blake3-derived index over the corpus and
//!   artifact κs (the `deterministic_project` pattern); the remaining
//!   centroids are chosen by greedy farthest-point traversal (ties to the
//!   lowest index), which spreads seeds across tight clusters
//!   deterministically — no iteration-order or RNG dependence anywhere.
//! - **Convergence**: at most [`MAX_KMEANS_ITERS`] iterations, stopping
//!   when every centroid coordinate is bit-identical between rounds
//!   (exact f32 compare; once assignments stop changing, the f64 sums and
//!   their normalizations are bit-identical, so this terminates well
//!   before the cap in practice). Empty clusters are reseeded with the
//!   farthest unchosen point; clusters still empty after the cap are
//!   dropped, so a clustering run can yield fewer regions than requested.
//! - **Multiresolution recursion**: depth 1 is a broad cover of
//!   `CoverConfig::k0` regions. A region at depth `< depths` splits into
//!   [`SPLIT_CHILDREN`] children only when **all** of: its support ≥
//!   `min_support`; the region budget has room; and the within-region
//!   next-token entropy reduction
//!   `H(parent) − Σ_c (|c|/|parent|)·H(c)` — computed from the corpus
//!   next-token distributions over the region's train members, tokens in
//!   ascending order, f64 — exceeds `entropy_gain_bits`. (v1 note: the
//!   entropy uses f64 `log2`, which is libm-sensitive cross-platform;
//!   same-machine determinism is pinned by the T-invariance tests, and
//!   cross-platform byte equality awaits the D2 canonical deterministic
//!   compile mode, exactly as for `compile()`'s macOS-pinned κ baseline.)
//! - **Objective scoring (schema 1)**: each eligible split records
//!   `H(A|R)` and `H(S_future|R)` proxies, an information-bottleneck term
//!   `I(Z;X) - beta·I(Z;Y_future)`, and runtime/artifact/bytes/structure
//!   cost proxies; weighted objective ties deterministically resolve to
//!   "keep". Fitting uses train observations only; reports emit both train
//!   and held-out decompositions so regressions are visible per component.
//!
//! # Regions, membership, reference classifier
//!
//! Each region carries: a unit f32 prototype (the centroid), binarized to
//! a sign-bit signature **exactly like the class-sig pipeline** (bit `d`
//! set iff prototype coordinate `d > 0.0`); an all-ones mask (v1); a
//! calibrated radius = a configurable percentile (95% by default) of member
//! masked-Hamming distances ([`compiler::quantile_radius`], the PR #38 logic);
//! parent id;
//! depth. **Overlapping membership** at a depth: the top-[`TOP_M`] regions
//! by masked-Hamming distance (ties to the lowest region id, the
//! [`runtime::assign_memberships_plain`] ordering) filtered to those
//! within radius, with the nearest region retained when nothing is in
//! range — the nearest-class backoff floor. The frozen
//! [`ReferenceClassifier`] reproduces exact compiler-side membership
//! (nearest prototype by cosine) as the normative semantics; routing
//! recall of the shipped binary path is measured against it.
//!
//! # Graph and artifact
//!
//! Parent/child refinement edges (E_r, kind 0) come from the recursion;
//! lateral neighbor edges (E_o, kind 1) join region pairs at one depth
//! whose top-M co-activation count over the train observations reaches
//! [`coactivation_min`], degree-capped at [`MAX_NEIGHBOR_EDGES`] per region
//! (peers ordered by count descending, id ascending; edges canonicalized
//! `src < dst`). The canonical edge array is sorted by `(src, kind, dst)`
//! so each node's refinement children are contiguous, and the reverse
//! index is sorted by `(dst, src, kind)` — the same conventions as
//! `convert_r4g1`, whose HEAD/section layout (W=5, 36-byte signatures,
//! v0 linear-count root prior in EMIT) this module reuses. The emitted
//! container must pass `uor_r4_graph_format::GraphView::parse` plus
//! `verify_cids` before it is returned (fail closed). EXCT is optional
//! per the slice scope and is omitted in v1.
