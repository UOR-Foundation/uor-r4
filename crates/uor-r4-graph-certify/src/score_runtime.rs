//! The Phase-4 reference scorer: the witness-replayable, integer-only
//! scoring model of the graph-compiler plan (§5 Phase 4, §6 runtime
//! contract, glossary "Scoring model") after the issue-#64 redesign.
//! Two rules, both scored per context:
//!
//! ```text
//! Rule 2 (D4 EXCT precedence): S(v) = B(v) + ΔX(X,v)
//!     when the deepest-populated-prefix EXCT probe resolves with total
//!     evidence ≥ EXCT_SUPPORT_MIN — exact-context evidence dominates and
//!     graph residuals are skipped entirely (status ExactContext).
//! Rule 1 (chain-telescoped):   S_graph(v) = T_selected(v) + ΔT-offset
//!     with T_r(v) = B(v) + Σ_{n ∈ chain(r)} ΔE(n,v) over the covered
//!     refinement chain of the selected active region (status Graph, or
//!     Novel when no active region has a covered chain at all).
//! ```
//!
//! The redesign fixes the confirmed double counting of the literal
//! Σ-over-cloud formula `B + Σ_{n∈A} ΔE + Σ_{m∈F} ΔT + ΔX` (Gate C:
//! 0.3% vs 31.7% TLA3 baseline; one token took +91.7 nats from 13
//! sibling-subtree emission lists and won 98% of 2,000 probes): emission
//! residuals are applied only along ONE refinement chain per context, so
//! correlated residuals of sibling regions sharing a refinement parent
//! can no longer stack. The old formula is retained as
//! [`GraphScorer::score_candidates_legacy`] for the Gate C side-by-side
//! comparison only; it is not the shipping semantics.
//!
//! Every contribution is a [`ScoreQ`] (Q16.16 log-domain integer); the
//! accumulation core — candidate union, contribution application, the
//! canonical argmax — uses ScoreQ saturating add/sub, integer compares,
//! and table reads only: no float, no multiply, no divide, no modulo.
//! Legacy TLS1 compatibility keeps one compiler-side float helper delimited
//! by `BEGIN/END COMPILER-SIDE FLOAT` markers and documented at
//! [`quantize_exct`]. The deployed RX1 path never calls it; the machine-
//! checked source scan (`tests/score.rs`) asserts the accumulation core
//! carries no `f32`/`f64` and no `*` `/` `%` value arithmetic.
//!
//! # Scoring semantics (normative)
//!
//! - **Active cloud A**: the top-`TOP_M` masked-Hamming memberships at
//!   each depth 1..=max_depth — exactly the
//!   [`super::cover::ReferenceClassifier::binary_memberships`] semantics
//!   (top-M by distance, ties to the lower region id, within-radius
//!   filter, nearest-region fallback), recomputed here over the region
//!   parameters recovered from the artifact's NODE/ROUT sections so the
//!   artifact alone is the scoring authority.
//! - **Covered chain of an active region r** (Rule 1): r's refinement
//!   ancestor path from the depth-1 region down to r, truncated at the
//!   first node whose calibrated radius does not cover the context
//!   signature — the [`binary_top1_covered`] radius semantics applied
//!   per node (within-radius masked Hamming; the nearest-region fallback
//!   is a routing behavior and never makes a node covered). The chain is
//!   the contiguous covered prefix root → … → deepest covered ancestor
//!   of r, so the telescoped sum `B + Σ ΔE` composes the refinement
//!   corrections instead of stacking siblings (each chain node enters at
//!   most once per candidate — Theorem 10 by construction).
//! - **Cloud combination**: the selected region is the active region
//!   whose covered chain is DEEPEST (the graph analog of the baseline's
//!   deepest-populated-class rule); ties break by higher membership
//!   margin (`radius − distance` of the active region itself), then by
//!   the lowest region id. Only the selected chain's emission lists
//!   apply ΔE.
//! - **Predicted cloud F**: the union of E_f edge targets of the active
//!   regions. Each predicted region m keeps its single best incoming
//!   edge (highest `score_q`, ties to the lowest canonical edge id).
//!   Under Rule 1 the token-independent edge-weight part is folded into
//!   the scalar `transition_offset = Σ_m w(n_m→m)` added to every
//!   candidate once (the witness records the applied edges and the
//!   offset); F emission lists generate candidates but contribute no
//!   residuals.
//! - **Candidates**: under Rule 1, the union of the emission lists of A ∪ F
//!   ∪ chain plus the root prior's top-`root_top_b` tokens. Under Rule 2,
//!   only the EXCT probe's admitted local entries are scored; mixing global
//!   root candidates into that local distribution would change the graded-
//!   store argmax. Every scored candidate receives one root-prior contribution
//!   before its residual, with the baked smoothing floor for absent tokens.
//! - **EXCT precedence (Rule 2)**: the existing prefix probe from
//!   `runtime::predict_witness_plain` (deepest populated prefix). Total
//!   evidence ≥ [`EXCT_SUPPORT_MIN`] ⇒ `S(v) = B(v) + ΔX(X,v)` over the
//!   admitted local entries, graph candidate generation skipped; below the
//!   gate the probe is recorded (admitted 0) and Rule 1 decides.
//! - **Status**: every prediction reports exactly one [`ScoreStatus`] —
//!   `ExactContext` (Rule 2 fired), `Graph` (Rule 1 with a non-empty
//!   selected chain), `Novel` (Rule 1 with no covered chain — Phase 5
//!   consumes this).
//! - **Selection**: the canonical tie-break — highest score, then the
//!   lowest token id (matches `runtime::predict_witness_plain`'s rule).
//!
//! # Theorem 10 by construction
//!
//! Contribution IDs are canonical: `RootPrior(token)`, `Emission(node,
//! token)`, `ExactContext(token)`, and one applied-edge id per predicted
//! region. Chain nodes are distinct refinement ancestors of one region,
//! so a node's emission list enters S(v) at most once per context — even
//! when the node is simultaneously active (ΔE) and predicted (ΔT), the
//! A ∪ F ∪ chain candidate union is deduplicated by node before any
//! emission is read, and only the selected chain applies. The induced
//! cover has no explicit overlap nodes, so there are no interaction
//! residuals this phase: the root-plus-residual decomposition attaches
//! every contribution to exactly one node. The witness verifier
//! independently rejects duplicate contribution IDs (belt-and-braces,
//! Theorem 10).
//!
//! # Witness and independent replay (Theorem 6)
//!
//! [`GraphScorer::score_candidates`] emits a bounded [`ScoreWitness`]:
//! graph CID, input code, the status (which rule fired), the selected
//! covered chain (empty under ExactContext/Novel), active regions +
//! margins, predicted cloud, applied transition edges + folded offset,
//! the EXCT probe record (when consulted), the selected token with its
//! full contribution list and score, the candidate count, and the op
//! census. [`verify_witness_replay`] rebuilds a fresh scorer **from the
//! validated R4G1 bytes** (plus the teacher TLA container when EXCT
//! evidence is present — checked against HEAD `teacher_cid`, so the
//! class-code derivation chains to pinned content), recomputes the
//! entire prediction without any compiler state, and requires bit-exact
//! equality of every witness field; duplicate contribution IDs are
//! rejected out of hand.
//!
//! # Op census
//!
//! Hamming membership runs through [`OpKernel`] (xor + popcount table +
//! add per byte), and emission/root/EXCT application, the candidate
//! scan, and the argmax are counted as adds / compares / table reads /
//! candidate scans. Bounded lookup structures (the root-prior map and
//! per-node emission maps) are built once at scorer construction — the
//! reference form of the deployed runtime's fixed tables; per-token
//! scoring itself performs no allocation-dependent work beyond the
//! candidate accumulation map (the deployed Phase-5 runtime replaces it
//! with fixed-capacity arrays).

// but heap-based. The deployed HTTP adapter needs the same Rule 1 /
// Rule 2 semantics on fixed-capacity buffers — zero allocation per
// prediction in steady state (the status-policy allocation census
// asserts it). `score_step` recomputes a prediction into a caller-owned
// [`StepState`] and reports the selection, the [`ScoreStatus`], the
// candidate count, and the op census — no witness, no per-call heap.
// Parity with `score_candidates` (selected token, score, status,
// candidate count) is asserted per probe signature by the status-policy
// probe suite whenever the reference runs the deployed configuration
// (predicted-cloud emissions off, residualized RX1 exact-context
// evidence).
//
// Two deliberate fail-closed restrictions:
// - predicted-cloud (F / delta-T) emissions must be off — the deployed
//   default since the #66 ablation;
// - exact-context evidence must be the residualized RX1 table. The
//   legacy raw-TLS1 fallback quantizes at probe time (the one delimited
//   float site above), which the deployed integer contract forbids;
//   [`GraphScorer::has_legacy_exct`] lets the adapter detect that case
//   and keep those artifacts on the reference path.
