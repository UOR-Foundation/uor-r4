//! Phase 4 of the graph-compiler plan (§5): semantic transitions and
//! ScoreQ residual emission onto the induced cover, plus the Gate C
//! measurement harness. This module is the COMPILER side — it may use
//! floats (documented below); the scoring path it emits for is the
//! integer-only reference scorer in [`super::score_runtime`].
//!
//! # What is compiled
//!
//! - **Forward transitions E_f** ([`compile_transitions`]): over
//!   consecutive train positions `(t, t+1)` in one story, the active
//!   cloud `A_t` (top-M memberships at each depth — the same
//!   `binary_memberships` semantics the cover and the scorer use) is
//!   crossed with `A_{t+1}` to accumulate `(src region, dst region)`
//!   counts per depth. Per source region the out-degree is bounded
//!   ([`ScoreConfig::transition_out_degree`], default 8) by the
//!   canonical order (weight desc, then dst asc); the edge weight is
//!   `ScoreQ::from_logprob(ln(count / src_total))` with `src_total` the
//!   pre-truncation evidence total. The reverse index E_b is built by
//!   sorting canonical edge IDs by `(dst, src, kind)` — Theorem 7
//!   consistency by construction, verified by
//!   [`verify_theorem_7_wired`] (the full per-node wiring, stronger
//!   than the format's v0 existence approximation).
//! - **Emission residuals ΔE** ([`compile_emissions`]): per region n
//!   with parent p(n),
//!   `ΔE(n,v) = ScoreQ::from_logprob(ln P(v|n) − ln P(v|p(n)))` where
//!   `P(v|n)` is the region's corpus next-token distribution — the
//!   store's top-3 teacher-weighted evidence over the train
//!   observations whose **covered** binary top-1 membership is n:
//!   within the region's calibrated radius, with no nearest-region
//!   fallback assignment (the backoff floor is a routing behavior, not
//!   region content — with fallback assignment, every observation would
//!   land in some region at every depth and deep regions' distributions
//!   would collect the whole corpus; see
//!   [`score_runtime::binary_top1_covered`]). The rule is deterministic
//!   and identical under re-induction and `--cover` reload. The
//!   smoothing rule is configurable ([`Smoothing`], issue #67
//!   calibration); the default is add-one smoothing over the compiled
//!   vocabulary: `P(v|n) = (count_n(v) + 1) / (total_n + V)`. The root
//!   prior B(v) is the level-0 store distribution with the same
//!   quantization and smoothing; the smoothing floor (`ln(1/(total + V))`
//!   under add-one) is baked into the EMIT root header. Each region's
//!   emission list is sparse and
//!   bounded: the top-E tokens by residual score
//!   ([`ScoreConfig::emission_entries`], default 64; selection order
//!   score desc then token asc, storage ascending token). The induced
//!   cover has no explicit overlap nodes, so no interaction residuals
//!   exist this phase — Theorem 10 non-duplication holds by
//!   construction (root-plus-residual decomposition; each contribution
//!   attached to exactly one node).
//! - **EXCT**: the compiler reads the TLS1 graded store as input, then emits
//!   a residualized RX1 table after the v0 storage descriptor. Each retained
//!   prefix entry stores `ΔX(X,v) = Q(ln P(v|X)) − B(v)` as an integer
//!   `ScoreQ`; the deployed scorer performs only table reads and integer
//!   addition. Legacy raw TLS1 graph artifacts remain readable by the
//!   certifier for migration compatibility.
//!
//! # Wire layout (EMIT remainder)
//!
//! ```text
//! root prior block:  u32 entry_count | u32 total_count
//!                    | i32 floor_score_q | u32 reserved(0)
//!                    entry_count × (i32 token, i32 score_q)   [token asc]
//! region lists:      per region (ascending region id), wired by the
//!                    PackedNode emission ranges (emission_start = byte
//!                    offset into the remainder, emission_len = entry
//!                    count ≤ HEAD E), each
//!                    emission_len × (i32 token, i32 score_q)  [token asc]
//! ```
//!
//! EDGE kind tags distinguish E_r (0), E_o (1), E_f (2); the canonical
//! edge array is sorted by `(src, kind, dst)` so each node's refinement
//! children stay contiguous (the `convert_r4g1`/`cover` convention).
//!
//! # Quantization and platform pinning
//!
//! All `ln` quantization is compiler-side f64→f32 through
//! `ScoreQ::from_logprob` — libm-sensitive cross-platform, **macOS-
//! pinned**, exactly the status of the existing κ baseline and the
//! cover's f64 entropy (the D2 canonical deterministic compile mode
//! resolves cross-platform byte equality later). The scoring path
//! itself is integer-only (see `score_runtime`).
//!
//! # Gate C
//!
//! [`evaluate_gate_c`] measures top-1 agreement with the corpus's
//! recorded teacher argmax and bits/token on the held-out partition for
//! four scorers side by side: the OLD Σ-over-cloud formula (kept for
//! comparison — the confirmed double counting lives there), NEW Rule 1
//! (chain-telescoped, no EXCT), NEW Rule 1+2 (with D4 EXCT precedence),
//! and the TLA3 store baseline (`runtime::predict_witness_plain` on the
//! same positions, Witten-Bell bits as in `evaluate-report`), plus
//! per-status (ExactContext/Graph/Novel) and per-rule win/loss
//! instrumentation. This is the M.V.G. checkpoint's fidelity input.
//!
//! # Two-sided context arms (#446 M1) — NOT a generation number
//!
//! Gate C also carries `rule12_twosided`, an instrumentation arm that
//! keys evidence on the PAIR of the left graded code prefix and a right
//! graded code prefix built from the tokens AFTER the target, and lets
//! that table take D4-style precedence wherever it resolves with
//! support. Its falsifier `rule12_twosided_shuffled` runs the identical
//! machinery with a right key taken from a foreign held-out position, so
//! any gain that survives it is right-context INFORMATION rather than
//! key cardinality.
//!
//! The arms exist to attack graded-code DILUTION. The graded code space
//! is fixed at `STAGES` x 256, so as the corpus grows an ever larger
//! share of held-out positions resolves at the FULL graded code, every
//! full-code cell absorbs more records, its next-token distribution
//! dilutes, and top-1 falls even though key resolution is nominally
//! maximal. The right key multiplies key resolution and splits those
//! over-diluted cells. `rule12_twosided_exct_slice` reports the two arms
//! restricted to the positions Rule 1+2 resolved as ExactContext, and
//! `twosided_keys_per_full_left` reports how many distinct two-sided
//! keys the right context carves each full left code into.
//!
//! Two-sided conditioning is NOT causally available to left-to-right
//! generation: at generation time the tokens after the target do not
//! exist. These rows are an INFILL / ANALYSIS measurement (the A-mode
//! regime) or, prospectively, a CONSTRUCTION-time signal. They must
//! never be quoted as a generation number. The table is built inside
//! [`evaluate_gate_c`] from the construction split alone; the artifact
//! format, the serving scorer's default path, the witness and the replay
//! contract are all untouched.
//!
//! # Latent right-context mixture (#446 M2) — causally legitimate
//!
//! The M1 rows above cannot be quoted because the right key is read at
//! SERVING time. M2 keeps the right context as a LATENT variable that is
//! observed only during CONSTRUCTION and marginalized away at serving:
//!
//! In prose, the mixture is `P(next | left) = SUM over classes c of
//! P(c | left) P(next | left, c)`.
//!
//! where c is a coarse class of the right graded code. Construction (the
//! non-held-out positions, which may legitimately look both ways because
//! nothing is being predicted there) accumulates two tables: the
//! class-conditional emission counts N(next | left prefix, c) and the
//! class posterior counts N(c | left prefix). Serving reads the LEFT key
//! only: it forms P(c | left) from the posterior table and mixes the
//! class-conditional distributions. No token after the target is touched
//! at evaluation time, so `rule12_latent_mix` IS a generation-legitimate
//! number.
//!
//! Four arms are reported on the identical Gate C held-out population:
//! `rule12_latent_mix` (the M2 arm), the left-only `rule12_precedence`
//! baseline it must beat, `rule12_latent_oracle` (the SAME tables with
//! the TRUE right class supplied at evaluation time — an upper bound,
//! NOT causal, and never quotable), and `rule12_latent_shuffled` (the
//! falsifier: the class posterior is taken from a FOREIGN left key under
//! a fixed rotation, holding class cardinality, emission tables,
//! smoothing and backoff constant). Without the falsifier row the
//! mixture row is not interpretable.
//!
//! EXIT RULE, pre-declared. `rule12_latent_mix` is a POSITIVE result if
//! and only if it beats the left-only Rule 1+2 baseline by at least two
//! percentage points of top-1 agreement on the same population AND beats
//! the shuffled-class falsifier's top-1. Anything else is a negative
//! result and must be reported as one. Bits per token are reported for
//! every arm regardless of the top-1 verdict, and
//! `latent_headroom_fraction` reports where the mixture sits between the
//! baseline and the oracle as a fraction of the available top-1
//! headroom.
//!
//! # Hard-select and top-k right-class arms (#446 M3)
//!
//! M2 measured NEGATIVE on top-1: the mixture lost half a point to the
//! left-only baseline while the oracle, using the SAME class-conditional
//! tables at the same class depth, gained more than five. The
//! class-conditional distributions are therefore sharp and correct and
//! it is the AVERAGING that destroys the argmax — a mixture of sharp
//! disagreeing modes has a flat mode. M3 tests the obvious repair:
//! SELECT a class instead of averaging over all of them.
//!
//! `rule12_latent_hard` picks the single most probable class from the
//! left key alone, `c* = argmax over c of P(c | left)` with the
//! canonical tie-break to the lowest class id, and predicts from
//! `P(next | left, c*)` under the same backoff, support gate and
//! Witten-Bell mixing as M2. `rule12_latent_topk` mixes only the `k`
//! highest-posterior classes renormalized (`R4_LATENT_TOPK`, default
//! three), interpolating between hard-select at `k = 1` and the full M2
//! marginalization at large `k`. Both read the LEFT key only, so both
//! are causally legitimate generation numbers.
//!
//! The quantity that decides whether the whole latent-class direction
//! can work is CLASS PREDICTABILITY: how often the left key's most
//! probable class IS the true right class. `latent_class_top1_accuracy`
//! reports it over the held-out positions carrying a right window, split
//! by whether the left key resolved at FULL graded depth or at a
//! backed-off prefix, and `latent_class_mean_entropy` reports the mean
//! entropy of the posterior in bits against
//! `latent_class_mean_support`. Near-chance accuracy means the direction
//! is dead and must be recorded plainly; high accuracy means hard-select
//! should approach the oracle.
//!
//! EXIT RULE, pre-declared. `rule12_latent_hard` is a POSITIVE result if
//! and only if it beats the left-only Rule 1+2 baseline by at least
//! [`LATENT_EXIT_MARGIN`] of top-1 agreement on the same population AND
//! beats the shuffled-class falsifier. Every arm's top-1 and bits per
//! token are reported regardless of the verdict, and every pre-existing
//! Gate C row is kept intact and reproducing.

/// (`latent_class_top1_accuracy` overall and split full-depth versus
/// backed-off, `latent_class_mean_entropy` against
/// `latent_class_mean_support`) measure whether the left key can predict
/// the right class at all, and `latent_hard_exit_rule_met` records the
