//! Phase 4 of the graph-compiler plan (§5): semantic transitions and
//! ScoreQ residual emission onto the induced cover, plus the Gate C
//! measurement harness. This module is the COMPILER side — it may use
//! floats (documented below); the scoring path it emits for is the
//! integer-only reference scorer in [`super::score_runtime`].
//!
//! # What is compiled
//!
//! - **Forward transitions E_f** ([`compile_transitions`]): over
//!   consecutive train positions `(t, t+1)` in one story, the active
//!   cloud `A_t` (top-M memberships at each depth — the same
//!   `binary_memberships` semantics the cover and the scorer use) is
//!   crossed with `A_{t+1}` to accumulate `(src region, dst region)`
//!   counts per depth. Per source region the out-degree is bounded
//!   ([`ScoreConfig::transition_out_degree`], default 8) by the
//!   canonical order (weight desc, then dst asc); the edge weight is
//!   `ScoreQ::from_logprob(ln(count / src_total))` with `src_total` the
//!   pre-truncation evidence total. The reverse index E_b is built by
//!   sorting canonical edge IDs by `(dst, src, kind)` — Theorem 7
//!   consistency by construction, verified by
//!   [`verify_theorem_7_wired`] (the full per-node wiring, stronger
//!   than the format's v0 existence approximation).
//! - **Emission residuals ΔE** ([`compile_emissions`]): per region n
//!   with parent p(n),
//!   `ΔE(n,v) = ScoreQ::from_logprob(ln P(v|n) − ln P(v|p(n)))` where
//!   `P(v|n)` is the region's corpus next-token distribution — the
//!   store's top-3 teacher-weighted evidence over the train
//!   observations whose **covered** binary top-1 membership is n:
//!   within the region's calibrated radius, with no nearest-region
//!   fallback assignment (the backoff floor is a routing behavior, not
//!   region content — with fallback assignment, every observation would
//!   land in some region at every depth and deep regions' distributions
//!   would collect the whole corpus; see
//!   [`score_runtime::binary_top1_covered`]). The rule is deterministic
//!   and identical under re-induction and `--cover` reload. The
//!   smoothing rule is configurable ([`Smoothing`], issue #67
//!   calibration); the default is add-one smoothing over the compiled
//!   vocabulary: `P(v|n) = (count_n(v) + 1) / (total_n + V)`. The root
//!   prior B(v) is the level-0 store distribution with the same
//!   quantization and smoothing; the smoothing floor (`ln(1/(total + V))`
//!   under add-one) is baked into the EMIT root header. Each region's
//!   emission list is sparse and
//!   bounded: the top-E tokens by residual score
//!   ([`ScoreConfig::emission_entries`], default 64; selection order
//!   score desc then token asc, storage ascending token). The induced
//!   cover has no explicit overlap nodes, so no interaction residuals
//!   exist this phase — Theorem 10 non-duplication holds by
//!   construction (root-plus-residual decomposition; each contribution
//!   attached to exactly one node).
//! - **EXCT**: the compiler reads the TLS1 graded store as input, then emits
//!   a residualized RX1 table after the v0 storage descriptor. Each retained
//!   prefix entry stores `ΔX(X,v) = Q(ln P(v|X)) − B(v)` as an integer
//!   `ScoreQ`; the deployed scorer performs only table reads and integer
//!   addition. Legacy raw TLS1 graph artifacts remain readable by the
//!   certifier for migration compatibility.
//!
//! # Wire layout (EMIT remainder)
//!
//! ```text
//! root prior block:  u32 entry_count | u32 total_count
//!                    | i32 floor_score_q | u32 reserved(0)
//!                    entry_count × (i32 token, i32 score_q)   [token asc]
//! region lists:      per region (ascending region id), wired by the
//!                    PackedNode emission ranges (emission_start = byte
//!                    offset into the remainder, emission_len = entry
//!                    count ≤ HEAD E), each
//!                    emission_len × (i32 token, i32 score_q)  [token asc]
//! ```
//!
//! EDGE kind tags distinguish E_r (0), E_o (1), E_f (2); the canonical
//! edge array is sorted by `(src, kind, dst)` so each node's refinement
//! children stay contiguous (the `convert_r4g1`/`cover` convention).
//!
//! # Quantization and platform pinning
//!
//! All `ln` quantization is compiler-side f64→f32 through
//! `ScoreQ::from_logprob` — libm-sensitive cross-platform, **macOS-
//! pinned**, exactly the status of the existing κ baseline and the
//! cover's f64 entropy (the D2 canonical deterministic compile mode
//! resolves cross-platform byte equality later). The scoring path
//! itself is integer-only (see `score_runtime`).
//!
//! # Gate C
//!
//! [`evaluate_gate_c`] measures top-1 agreement with the corpus's
//! recorded teacher argmax and bits/token on the held-out partition for
//! four scorers side by side: the OLD Σ-over-cloud formula (kept for
//! comparison — the confirmed double counting lives there), NEW Rule 1
//! (chain-telescoped, no EXCT), NEW Rule 1+2 (with D4 EXCT precedence),
//! and the TLA3 store baseline (`runtime::predict_witness_plain` on the
//! same positions, Witten-Bell bits as in `evaluate-report`), plus
//! per-status (ExactContext/Graph/Novel) and per-rule win/loss
//! instrumentation. This is the M.V.G. checkpoint's fidelity input.
