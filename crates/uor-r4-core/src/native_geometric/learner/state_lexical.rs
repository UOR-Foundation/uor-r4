//! A learned, state-conditioned lexical decoder for one owned answer.
//!
//! # Why this replaces a finite context key
//!
//! The retained `lexical_realization` prototype indexed a single argmax table by causal *flags*
//! (relation, requested history, derived/prior-difference bits, copy stage and a clipped count of
//! emitted vocabulary words). Its own doc comment states the obstruction: the actual generated token
//! identities and the evidence content do not enter the key. While the copy stage and the context are
//! fixed, inserting another word leaves the key unchanged, so a deterministic argmax repeats the same
//! choice and an external cap has to intervene. Two different values with identical flags cannot
//! change an uncopied word, and two equal-length prefixes that differ only in the symbols they
//! actually emitted cannot condition different continuations.
//!
//! This module supplies the missing dependency directly, following the responsibility split in the
//! principal brief:
//!
//! ```text
//! c       = causal pinned request + selected evidence/derived result + provenance
//! h_0     = learned_init(c)
//! a_t     = learned_readout(h_t, c, exact_copy_state)
//! x_t     = execute(a_t)          // a generated token, an exact owned token, or Stop
//! h_(t+1) = learned_transition(h_t, action_symbol(a_t))
//! ```
//!
//! * `c` is a *content* vector: a position-resolved embedding of the selected owned payload tokens
//!   and, for a consumed computation, of the operand the computation started from, plus a **typed
//!   causal block**. Position-dependent rows make the feature order-sensitive, a dedicated tail
//!   position carries the final token of a truncated payload, and an unfitted token occupies an
//!   explicit reserved row rather than contributing nothing. The typed block exposes exact,
//!   causally-available distinctions the compressed embedding cannot rediscover: requested history,
//!   whether the answer is derived, whether an older committed value was superseded, whether a store
//!   mutation was actually committed, whether the derived query key differs from the operand key, and
//!   the exact equality / prefix / divergence of the selected and operand identities. These are typed
//!   observations, not a supplied answer class: the learner still decides whether and how to verbalise
//!   them.
//! * `h_t` is a bounded integer state vector. `learned_transition` consumes the executed action event
//!   *and the actual emitted token identity*, so an inserted word and a copied word both advance the
//!   recurrence by the learned row of the token the session really emitted. Two equal-length copied
//!   spans over different fitted tokens therefore reach different states. An unfitted copied token
//!   still shares the reserved row; that residual collision is declared, not hidden.
//!
//! Exact copy identity, cursor and payload bytes stay separately owned by the scoped session; this
//! decoder never replaces identity with lossy state. A copied token carries both its exact byte (owned
//! elsewhere) and its learned identity into the recurrence.
//!
//! # Serving contract (D0-b)
//!
//! All weight maps are ternary (`TernaryLinear`: two bits per weight, power-of-two per-row scale) and
//! the learned embeddings are small integers stored as `i8` table reads. Serving therefore executes
//! table reads, integer additions/subtractions, shifts, comparisons and an argmax: no multiplier
//! instruction and no floating point. The bounded clamp is a compare/select, not arithmetic.
//!
//! # Learning
//!
//! Fitting is offline and explicitly floating point: a small recurrent decoder is trained by teacher
//! forcing with Adam and *quantisation-aware* straight-through estimators, so the served integer model
//! has the same quantized affine arithmetic used by the fitting forward pass. This is a dense
//! recurrent model implemented with bounded low-bit additive maps: the state width is declared by
//! `SlFitConfig`, map codes are ternary, embeddings are 4-bit, and biases are integer accumulators.
//! It is not a geometric-routing mechanism; no geometric advantage follows from this representation.
